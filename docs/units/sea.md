# Sea Units

This document describes the naval units available in DCS World, organized by vessel class. Each entry includes the DCS display name, type ID for mission files, operational role, and real-world background.

## Ship Classifications

Naval vessels are classified by size, armament, and intended role. These classifications evolved over centuries and continue to adapt as technology changes warfare at sea. While modern navies sometimes blur these distinctions, the traditional hierarchy provides useful context for understanding a fleet's composition and capabilities.

**Aircraft Carriers** are the largest surface combatants, designed to launch and recover fixed-wing aircraft. Fleet carriers (designated CV or CVN for nuclear-powered) operate catapult-launched aircraft and form the centerpiece of a carrier strike group, projecting power across vast distances. Light carriers and amphibious assault ships (LHA/LHD) are smaller vessels that operate helicopters and short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft like the Harrier. Carriers themselves carry minimal offensive armament, relying instead on their air wings and escorting warships for protection.

**Battlecruisers** occupy an unusual position between cruisers and the now-obsolete battleships. Only Russia operates battlecruisers today, with the Kirov-class vessels displacing over 25,000 tons and carrying massive anti-ship missile batteries alongside extensive air defense systems. These ships are designed to hunt carrier battle groups or lead surface action groups, combining the firepower of a battleship with cruiser-like speed.

**Cruisers** are large, multi-mission surface combatants ranging from 9,000 to 12,000 tons. In modern navies, cruisers primarily serve as air defense coordinators, using powerful radar systems and long-range surface-to-air missiles to protect carrier strike groups or lead independent task forces. American Ticonderoga-class cruisers with the Aegis Combat System exemplify this role. Russian cruisers like the Slava class emphasize anti-ship missiles for striking at enemy fleets.

**Destroyers** evolved from small torpedo boats designed to "destroy" enemy torpedo craft and now serve as the backbone of most surface fleets. Modern destroyers range from 6,000 to 10,000 tons and perform multiple roles including anti-air, anti-submarine, and anti-surface warfare. The distinction between cruisers and destroyers has blurred considerably, with large destroyers like the Arleigh Burke class rivaling cruisers in capability. Destroyers typically operate as escorts for carrier groups or in independent surface action groups.

**Frigates** are smaller than destroyers, typically 3,000 to 4,500 tons, and were traditionally specialized for convoy escort and anti-submarine warfare. The frigate prioritizes endurance and seakeeping over raw combat power, making them economical platforms for patrol, presence, and protection of merchant shipping. Modern frigates increasingly carry area air defense systems, narrowing the gap with destroyers. Many navies that cannot afford destroyer fleets rely on frigates as their primary surface combatants.

**Corvettes** are the smallest ocean-going warships, typically 500 to 3,000 tons, designed for coastal defense and littoral operations. Corvettes sacrifice range and seakeeping for reduced cost, allowing navies to maintain larger numbers of hulls for patrol and presence missions. Despite their size, corvettes can carry potent anti-ship missiles, making them dangerous opponents in confined waters. Russia's Tarantul-class corvettes, armed with supersonic Moskit missiles, exemplify how small platforms can threaten much larger vessels.

**Fast Attack Craft** (FAC) are small, high-speed vessels under 500 tons designed for hit-and-run attacks with missiles or torpedoes. These boats trade protection and endurance for speed and concentrated firepower, attacking from coastal waters and retreating before escorts can respond. Fast attack craft are particularly effective in archipelagic waters, straits, and littorals where their small size and shallow draft provide tactical advantages.

**Submarines** operate beneath the surface, providing stealth capabilities unmatched by surface ships. Nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN) can remain submerged indefinitely, hunting enemy submarines and surface ships or launching cruise missiles. Conventional diesel-electric submarines (SSK) are quieter when running on batteries but must periodically surface or snorkel to recharge, limiting their endurance. Both types are extremely difficult to detect and track, making anti-submarine warfare one of the most challenging naval disciplines.

**Amphibious Warfare Ships** are specialized vessels that transport ground forces and their equipment for landing operations. Landing Platform Docks (LPD) carry troops, vehicles, and landing craft in a well deck. Landing Ships Tank (LST) can beach themselves to discharge vehicles directly onto shore. Amphibious assault ships combine helicopter flight decks with well decks to deliver Marines by both air and sea. These vessels form the core of naval expeditionary capability, allowing ground forces to strike from the sea.

## Aircraft Carriers

### United States Navy

**CVN-70 Carl Vinson** (`VINSON`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1982 as the third of ten ships in the class. The 332-meter ship displaces approximately 100,000 tons and serves as the centerpiece of a carrier strike group. Armed with RIM-7 Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles and Phalanx CIWS for self-defense. The air wing typically comprises four strike fighter squadrons, one electronic attack squadron, one early warning squadron, one helicopter maritime strike squadron, and one helicopter sea combat squadron, totaling roughly 70-80 aircraft.

Carl Vinson participated in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and has deployed repeatedly to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf. The ship conducted strike operations during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2011, the ship gained notoriety as the site from which Osama bin Laden's remains were buried at sea following the Abbottabad raid. In DCS, the Vinson provides catapult-assisted takeoff and arrested recovery (CATOBAR) operations with four steam catapults, four arresting wires, TACAN and ICLS navigation aids.

**CVN-71 Theodore Roosevelt** (`CVN_71`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1986. Nicknamed "The Big Stick," the ship has seen extensive combat operations across three decades. Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Persian Gulf on 16 January 1991 and launched her first combat strikes on 19 January, with her air wing flying over 4,200 sorties during Operation Desert Storm—more than any other carrier in the conflict. The ship has deployed repeatedly to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean, conducting strikes against Yugoslav forces in 1999 during Operation Allied Force, operating in Afghanistan after 9/11, and participating in Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIS beginning in 2015.

Armed with RIM-7 Sea Sparrow and RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles for air defense, plus Phalanx CIWS for close-in protection. Features four steam catapults and four arresting wires for CATOBAR operations. The ship's air wing can generate over 200 combat sorties per day during surge operations.

**CVN-72 Abraham Lincoln** (`CVN_72`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1989. Lincoln participated in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and conducted years of patrol flights enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq during Operation Southern Watch. The ship deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom after 9/11 and participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. The ship underwent refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) from 2013 to 2017.

Armed with Sea Sparrow and RAM surface-to-air missiles plus Phalanx CIWS. The nuclear reactors provide essentially unlimited range, with the ship's endurance limited only by aviation fuel and ordnance supplies, which can be replenished underway.

**CVN-73 George Washington** (`CVN_73`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1992. George Washington served as the forward-deployed carrier in Yokosuka, Japan from 2008 to 2015, providing rapid response capability in the Western Pacific. From this position, the ship could reach potential flashpoints in the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, or South China Sea within days. The ship provides power projection capabilities in support of U.S. treaty obligations with Japan, South Korea, and other Pacific allies.

Armed with NATO Sea Sparrow, Rolling Airframe Missiles, and Phalanx CIWS for self-defense. Features four C-13-2 steam catapults and four arresting wires. The ship has participated in numerous multinational exercises demonstrating interoperability with allied navies.

**CVN-74 John C. Stennis** (`Stennis`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1995. Stennis has deployed extensively to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf, participating in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The ship conducted combat operations launching strikes against Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan and later against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Stennis has also participated in numerous freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea.

Armed with Sea Sparrow and RAM missiles plus Phalanx CIWS. In DCS, Stennis provides CATOBAR operations with four steam catapults, four arresting wires, and TACAN/ICLS navigation aids.

**CVN-75 Harry S. Truman** (`CVN_75`)

Nimitz-class nuclear-powered supercarrier commissioned in 1998. Truman has conducted extensive combat operations in the 21st century, deploying repeatedly to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean. The ship's air wing flew thousands of strike sorties during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Inherent Resolve against ISIS, including strikes in both Iraq and Syria. Truman has operated in the Eastern Mediterranean and served as part of NATO responses to Russian aggression in Europe.

Armed with Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, Rolling Airframe Missiles, and Phalanx CIWS. Features four steam catapults and four arresting wires for CATOBAR operations. The Evolved Sea Sparrow provides improved performance against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles compared to earlier Sea Sparrow variants.

**CV-59 Forrestal** (`Forrestal`)

Lead ship of the Forrestal class, commissioned in 1955 as the first supercarrier designed from the keel up to operate jet aircraft. At 325 meters, Forrestal introduced the angled flight deck, steam catapults, and enclosed hurricane bow that became standard on subsequent American carriers. The ship could operate 80-90 aircraft and served as the template for all subsequent U.S. supercarriers through the Kitty Hawk and Nimitz classes.

Forrestal conducted combat operations during the Vietnam War, launching strikes from Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. The ship is remembered for the devastating fire of 29 July 1967, when a Zuni rocket accidentally fired on the flight deck, striking an A-4 Skyhawk loaded with bombs. The resulting fires and explosions killed 134 sailors and injured 161. The disaster led to major improvements in damage control training, firefighting equipment, and ordnance handling procedures throughout the Navy. Armed with RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles and Phalanx CIWS in later refits. Forrestal served until 1993 and was scrapped in 2015.

**LHA-1 Tarawa** (`LHA_Tarawa`)

Lead ship of the Tarawa-class amphibious assault ships, commissioned in 1976. At 254 meters, these ships combined the functions of several amphibious ship types into a single hull, carrying a Marine battalion landing team of 1,900 troops with helicopters, AV-8B Harrier STOVL aircraft, landing craft, and armored vehicles. The well deck can accommodate four LCU landing craft or two LCACs (air-cushion landing craft), while the flight deck supports simultaneous operations of multiple helicopters.

Armed with two RAM launchers, two Phalanx CIWS, and various machine guns for self-defense. In DCS, supports STOVL and helicopter operations. The Tarawa class established the model for subsequent Wasp and America-class amphibious assault ships.

**Essex Class Carrier 1944** (`Essex`)

Essex-class carriers formed the backbone of the U.S. Navy's fast carrier task forces during the Pacific War. Entering service from 1942, the class would eventually number 24 ships, with fourteen seeing combat during World War II. At 266 meters and 27,000 tons, these carriers could operate 90-100 aircraft including F6F Hellcats, F4U Corsairs, SB2C Helldivers, and TBF Avengers.

The Essex class served as the primary striking arm of the Third and Fifth Fleets, participating in virtually every major Pacific campaign from late 1943 onward. Essex-class carriers destroyed Japanese naval aviation at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, where American pilots shot down over 300 Japanese aircraft in the "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot." At Leyte Gulf in October 1944, Essex-class air groups sank the super-battleship Musashi and crippled the Japanese Combined Fleet. Armed with twelve 5-inch/38 dual-purpose guns and extensive 40mm Bofors and 20mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft batteries. The carriers endured kamikaze strikes and continued operations, with their crews developing the damage control expertise that became a hallmark of the U.S. Navy. Many Essex-class ships served into the jet age, conducting combat operations in Korea and Vietnam.

### Russian Navy

**CV 1143.5 Admiral Kuznetsov** (`KUZNECOW`)

Russia's only operational aircraft carrier, designated an aircraft-carrying cruiser to permit transit of the Turkish Straits under the Montreux Convention. Commissioned in 1990 as the Soviet Union collapsed, Kuznetsov operates Su-33 and MiG-29K fighters using a 12-degree ski-jump ramp rather than catapults (STOBAR configuration). At 305 meters, the ship displaces 58,000 tons fully loaded and serves as flagship of the Northern Fleet.

Unlike Western carriers focused purely on aviation, Kuznetsov carries significant offensive armament: 12 P-700 Granit supersonic anti-ship missiles in vertical launch tubes capable of Mach 2.5 flight and carrying 750kg warheads to ranges exceeding 500 km. Air defense comprises 192 3K95 Kinzhal (SA-N-9 Gauntlet) SAMs with 12 km range, and 8 Kashtan CIWS combining 30mm guns with 9M311 missiles.

Kuznetsov deployed to the Mediterranean during the Syrian Civil War in 2016-2017, conducting combat operations with her air wing striking targets in Syria. The deployment was troubled, with two aircraft lost to deck accidents—a MiG-29K and a Su-33 crashed when arresting cables failed. The ship has suffered from repeated mechanical problems and a major fire during refit in 2019.

**CV 1143.5 Admiral Kuznetsov (2017)** (`CV_1143_5`)

Updated model of Admiral Kuznetsov representing the ship's 2017 configuration during its Syrian deployment. The air wing during Operation Kuznetsov consisted of Su-33 and MiG-29KR fighters conducting strikes from the Mediterranean. Despite the operational difficulties, the deployment marked the first combat use of carrier-based aviation in Russian naval history. Weapons and sensors as per the standard Kuznetsov configuration.

### Royal Navy

**HMS Invincible (R05)** (`hms_invincible`)

Lead ship of the Invincible-class light aircraft carriers, commissioned in 1980. At 209 meters and 22,000 tons full load, these ships were originally designed as through-deck cruisers for anti-submarine warfare before being reclassified as aircraft carriers.

Invincible gained fame during the 1982 Falklands War as flagship of the British Task Force. Her Sea Harrier FRS.1 fighters achieved complete air superiority over Argentine forces, destroying 20 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat without a single loss. The Sea Harriers' ability to operate from the small flight deck and their use of the "viffing" maneuver (vectoring in forward flight) to outmaneuver opponents proved decisive. The ship operated in the Total Exclusion Zone for the duration of the conflict, enduring numerous air attacks while coordinating fleet air defense.

Armed with Sea Dart GWS 30 twin-arm launcher (22 missiles) providing area air defense out to 40 km, plus Phalanx CIWS. Features a 7-degree ski-jump ramp for STOVL operations. Invincible later participated in operations in the Adriatic during the Balkans conflicts of the 1990s and served as a platform for British operations in the Persian Gulf. Decommissioned in 2005 and scrapped in 2011. In DCS, supports Sea Harrier and helicopter operations for the South Atlantic terrain.

### Argentine Navy

**ARA Veinticinco de Mayo** (`ara_vdm`)

Colossus-class light carrier originally commissioned as HMS Venerable in 1945, sold to the Netherlands as HNLMS Karel Doorman in 1948, and purchased by Argentina in 1968. At 212 meters, the ship served as flagship of the Argentine fleet, operating A-4Q Skyhawks and S-2 Trackers.

During the Falklands War, Veinticinco de Mayo posed the most significant threat to the British Task Force. On 1-2 May 1982, the carrier positioned for a strike against British forces, with A-4Q Skyhawks loaded with bombs ready to launch. The attack was aborted when insufficient wind prevented launch operations—the aging steam catapult required 40 knots of relative wind over the deck, and calm conditions made the strike impossible. Hours later, the British nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror sank the cruiser ARA General Belgrano, and the threat of further submarine attacks forced Veinticinco de Mayo to withdraw to coastal waters for the remainder of the war. The Argentine surface fleet effectively ceased offensive operations after 2 May.

Armed with ten 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns. The carrier was fitted with a steam catapult and arresting wires. Decommissioned in 1997 and scrapped in 2000. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

**SS Atlantic Conveyor** (`atconveyor`)

British container ship requisitioned and converted to an aircraft transport during the Falklands War. Atlantic Conveyor was modified with a flight deck and carried critical aviation assets to the South Atlantic: six Wessex helicopters, three Chinook heavy-lift helicopters, one Lynx, plus Harrier GR.3s to reinforce the carrier air groups.

On 25 May 1982, while operating as an aircraft ferry and stores ship for the task force, the vessel was struck by two AM39 Exocet anti-ship missiles fired by Argentine Navy Super Etendards. The Exocets had been launched at the carriers, but decoy countermeasures drew them toward Atlantic Conveyor instead. The missiles struck the port side, starting fires that spread through the ship. The crew abandoned ship, but 12 men died including Captain Ian North.

The loss of the helicopters proved devastating to British logistics. Only one Chinook had been transferred to the carriers before the attack. Without the heavy-lift capability those helicopters would have provided, British troops were forced to march ("yomp") 56 miles across East Falkland carrying full combat loads, rather than being airlifted forward. The ship was unarmed. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

## Battlecruisers

### Russian Navy

**Battlecruiser 1144.2 Pyotr Velikiy** (`PIOTR`)

Kirov-class (Project 1144.2 Orlan) nuclear-powered battlecruiser, the largest and heaviest surface combatant in the world aside from aircraft carriers. At 252 meters and 28,000 tons full load, Pyotr Velikiy was commissioned in 1998 and serves as flagship of the Northern Fleet.

The ship was designed to operate independently or lead surface action groups hunting NATO carrier battle groups during a potential conflict. The nuclear propulsion provides essentially unlimited range and allows sustained high-speed operations without the logistical constraints of conventional propulsion.

The battlecruiser's armament is formidable. Primary anti-surface capability comes from 20 P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 Shipwreck) supersonic anti-ship missiles in below-deck launchers, capable of Mach 2.5 flight with 750kg warheads to ranges exceeding 500 km. The missiles can coordinate attacks in swarms, with one missile flying high as a targeting coordinator while others approach at sea-skimming altitude. Area air defense comprises 96 S-300F Fort (SA-N-6 Grumble) long-range SAMs in vertical launchers with 90 km range, supplemented by 128 3K95 Kinzhal (SA-N-9 Gauntlet) point-defense missiles with 12 km range. Close-in defense includes 6 Kashtan CIWS, each combining twin 30mm gatling guns with 9M311 missiles. Gun armament consists of twin AK-130 130mm dual-purpose guns capable of 60 rounds per minute. Anti-submarine weapons include RBU-1000 rockets and torpedo tubes.

Pyotr Velikiy has conducted numerous high-profile deployments, including Mediterranean cruises and Arctic operations. With a detection range of 250 km and threat range of 190 km, the ship represents one of the most dangerous surface combatants in DCS.

## Cruisers

### United States Navy

**CG Ticonderoga** (`TICONDEROG`)

Lead ship of the Ticonderoga class, the first surface combatants equipped with the Aegis Combat System. Commissioned in 1983, these 173-meter, 9,800-ton cruisers revolutionized naval air defense with their AN/SPY-1 phased array radar, which can track over 100 targets simultaneously while guiding missiles against multiple threats.

Ticonderoga-class ships serve as the primary air defense coordinators for carrier strike groups, controlling the battlespace and directing fighter aircraft. The Aegis Combat System provides automated threat detection, tracking, and engagement, dramatically reducing reaction time against incoming missiles and aircraft. The class carries 122 Mk 41 Vertical Launch System cells loaded with SM-2 Standard surface-to-air missiles (range 150+ km), Tomahawk cruise missiles for land attack (range 1,600+ km), and ASROC for anti-submarine warfare. Later ships carry SM-6 missiles with active terminal guidance. Additional armament includes two 5-inch Mk 45 guns, two Phalanx CIWS, eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and torpedo tubes.

Ticonderoga-class cruisers have participated in virtually every U.S. military operation since their commissioning, including launching Tomahawk strikes against Iraq in 1991 and 2003, Libya in 1986, and targets in Afghanistan, Sudan, and Syria. In DCS, the class has a 150 km detection range and 100 km threat range.

### Russian Navy

**Cruiser 1164 Moskva** (`MOSCOW`)

Lead ship of the Slava class (Project 1164 Atlant), commissioned in 1983 as Slava and renamed Moskva in 1995. At 186 meters and 12,000 tons, these cruisers are instantly recognizable by the sixteen P-500 Bazalt (SS-N-12 Sandbox) or upgraded P-1000 Vulkan supersonic anti-ship missiles in massive angled twin-tube launchers along the hull.

Designed as "carrier killers" to hunt NATO carrier battle groups, the Slava class provided the Soviet Navy's surface forces with the ability to threaten American carriers at ranges exceeding 500 km. The missiles fly at Mach 2.5, making interception difficult. Air defense comprises 64 S-300F Fort (SA-N-6 Grumble) long-range SAMs in eight revolving vertical launchers with 90 km range, and 40 Osa-M (SA-N-4 Gecko) short-range SAMs. Close-in defense includes six AK-630 30mm CIWS. Gun armament consists of a twin AK-130 130mm dual-purpose mount.

Moskva served as flagship of the Black Sea Fleet for nearly three decades. On 14 April 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the ship sank in the Black Sea following an explosion. Ukraine claimed the ship was struck by two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles; Russia stated an onboard ammunition fire caused the sinking. Regardless of cause, the loss of the Black Sea Fleet's flagship—and the largest warship sunk in combat since the Falklands War—demonstrated the continuing vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles. In DCS, the ship represents the pre-2022 configuration with a 160 km detection range and 75 km threat range.

## Destroyers

### United States Navy

**DDG Arleigh Burke IIa** (`USS_Arleigh_Burke_IIa`)

Flight IIA variant of the Arleigh Burke class, the backbone of the U.S. Navy's surface fleet. Entering service from 2000, Flight IIA ships measure 155 meters and 9,200 tons, adding helicopter hangars for two MH-60R Seahawks to enhance organic anti-submarine capability. The class represents the culmination of decades of destroyer development and serves as the most numerous surface combatant in the Western world.

These multi-mission destroyers serve in carrier strike groups providing air defense, operate independently for ballistic missile defense, and conduct surface warfare and strike missions. The AN/SPY-1D(V) Aegis Combat System provides integrated air and missile defense. Armed with 96 Mk 41 VLS cells carrying SM-2 Standard missiles (range 150+ km) and SM-6 missiles with active terminal guidance and anti-ship capability, Tomahawk cruise missiles for land attack, and ESSM (Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles) for close-range air defense providing up to four missiles per VLS cell against sea-skimmers. Gun armament includes one 5-inch Mk 45 gun and two Phalanx CIWS.

Arleigh Burke-class destroyers have conducted combat operations worldwide, launching Tomahawk strikes against targets in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria. Ships of this class have shot down ballistic missiles in tests, demonstrating the class's role in theater missile defense. In DCS, the class has a 150 km detection range and 100 km threat range.

### People's Liberation Army Navy

**Type 052B Destroyer** (`Type_052B`)

Chinese guided missile destroyer (Guangzhou class) entering service in 2004. At 154 meters and 5,850 tons, only two ships of this class were built as development platforms for subsequent indigenous designs, but they established the hull form and systems integration approach used in later Chinese destroyers.

These destroyers serve as multi-role escorts for PLAN surface action groups. Armed with two single-arm launchers for 48 Russian-origin SA-N-12 Grizzly (9M317/Shtil) medium-range surface-to-air missiles with 50 km range, 16 YJ-83 (C-803) anti-ship missiles in quad launchers with 180 km range, one 100mm dual-purpose gun, two Type 730 CIWS with 30mm seven-barrel gatlings, and anti-submarine torpedoes. The class features a stealthy hull design with reduced radar cross-section that influenced later Chinese warship construction.

**Type 052C Destroyer** (`Type_052C`)

Chinese guided missile destroyer (Lanzhou class) known as the "Chinese Aegis" for its four-panel Type 348 active phased array radar similar in concept to the American SPY-1. Entering service from 2005, these 155-meter, 7,000-ton destroyers provide area air defense for PLAN carrier strike groups and surface action groups.

The Type 348 radar provides 360-degree coverage and can track hundreds of targets simultaneously, allowing the ship to serve as the air defense coordinator for a naval task force. Armed with 48 HQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missiles in cold-launch VLS cells (range exceeding 100 km against aircraft, with some capability against tactical ballistic missiles), 8 YJ-62 (C-602) anti-ship cruise missiles with 400 km range, one 100mm dual-purpose gun, two Type 730 CIWS, and anti-submarine weapons. Six ships were built before production shifted to the improved Type 052D with superior VLS and radar systems.

## Frigates

### United States Navy

**FFG Oliver Hazard Perry** (`PERRY`)

Lead ship of the numerous Oliver Hazard Perry class, the last operational U.S. Navy frigates. Entering service from 1977, 71 ships were built for the U.S. Navy and allied navies, making it one of the largest warship classes of the Cold War era. At 136 meters and 4,100 tons, these frigates were designed as affordable escorts for convoy and amphibious group protection.

The class was designed specifically for anti-submarine warfare in the open ocean, countering Soviet submarine threats to Atlantic convoys during a potential World War III. Armed with a single-arm Mk 13 launcher carrying 40 SM-1 Standard missiles (40 km range) and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, one 76mm OTO Melara gun with a rate of fire of 80 rounds per minute, Phalanx CIWS, and two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes for Mk 46 ASW torpedoes. The class carried two SH-60 Seahawk helicopters for extended ASW reach, allowing the ship to detect and attack submarines at ranges beyond its hull-mounted sonar.

Perry-class frigates saw combat during the 1987-1988 "Tanker War" in the Persian Gulf. USS Stark was struck by two Iraqi Exocet missiles on 17 May 1987, killing 37 sailors but remaining afloat—demonstrating both the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and the class's damage resistance. USS Samuel B. Roberts struck an Iranian mine in 1988 but survived and was repaired. During Operation Praying Mantis, the retaliatory strikes against Iran, Perry-class frigates participated in sinking the Iranian frigate Sahand. The U.S. Navy decommissioned its last Perry-class frigate in 2015, though many continue service with allied nations.

### Russian Navy

**Frigate 11540 Neustrashimy** (`NEUSTRASH`)

Lead ship of the Neustrashimy-class (Project 11540 Yastreb), designed as anti-submarine frigates for the Soviet Navy. At 129 meters and 4,250 tons, only two ships were completed due to the Soviet collapse, with Neustrashimy commissioned in 1993.

These frigates serve as escorts for the Baltic Fleet, specialized in ASW operations in the shallow and confined waters of the Baltic Sea. Armed with 32 3K95 Kinzhal (SA-N-9 Gauntlet) SAMs in vertical launchers for point defense with 12 km range, 16 Kh-35 Uran (SS-N-25 Switchblade) anti-ship missiles with 130 km range—the Russian equivalent of the Harpoon, one 100mm gun, two Kashtan CIWS combining 30mm guns with 9M311 missiles, 533mm torpedo tubes, and RBU-6000 anti-submarine rockets. The class features the MGK-365 Zvezda-M1 sonar system for submarine detection and can operate one Ka-27 Helix helicopter. The combination of anti-submarine and anti-ship capability makes these versatile escorts despite their small numbers.

**Frigate 1135M Rezky** (`REZKY`)

Krivak II-class frigate (Project 1135M Burevestnik), one of the workhorses of the Soviet Navy's anti-submarine forces. Entering service from 1970, at 123 meters and 3,200 tons, over 40 Krivak variants were built, forming the backbone of Soviet convoy escort forces.

The Krivak class was designed specifically to counter NATO submarines in the Atlantic approaches and Barents Sea, where American and British submarines threatened Soviet ballistic missile submarines and surface forces. Armed with four SS-N-14 Silex anti-submarine missiles with nuclear or torpedo warheads (55 km range), the Krivak could attack submarines at standoff distance. Gun armament consists of two twin 76mm mounts for anti-aircraft and surface fire. Torpedo armament includes four 533mm torpedo tubes. Anti-submarine rocket launchers include two RBU-6000 with 6 km range for close-range attacks. Air defense comprises 40 4K33 Osa-M (SA-N-4 Gecko) short-range SAMs in a twin retractable launcher with 10 km range. The 1135M variant features enhanced sensors including the MGK-345 Bronza sonar for improved submarine detection.

### People's Liberation Army Navy

**Type 054A Frigate** (`Type_054A`)

Chinese guided missile frigate (Jiangkai II class) entering service from 2008, with over 40 hulls built, making it the most numerous modern frigate class in the world. At 134 meters and 4,050 tons, the Type 054A has become the workhorse of the PLAN surface fleet.

The Type 054A provides area air defense with 32 HQ-16 medium-range SAMs (derived from the Russian Shtil/Buk system) in vertical launch cells with 40+ km range. This represents a major capability increase over previous Chinese frigates, which could only provide point defense. Also armed with 8 YJ-83 (C-803) anti-ship missiles with 180 km range, one 76mm gun, two Type 730 CIWS, and two triple torpedo tubes for anti-submarine warfare. The ships carry a Ka-28 or Z-9 helicopter for over-the-horizon targeting and ASW.

Type 054A frigates form the backbone of the PLAN's escort forces, accompanying the Liaoning and Shandong carrier strike groups. The class frequently deploys on anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden—China's first sustained blue-water naval operations—and shows the flag worldwide, demonstrating China's expanding naval reach.

### Royal Navy

**HMS Achilles (F12)** (`leander-gun-achilles`)

Leander-class frigate commissioned in 1970, part of the final Batch 3 construction. At 113 meters and 2,860 tons, the Leander class was the most successful British frigate design of the Cold War, with 26 ships built for the Royal Navy plus variants for allied navies.

These general-purpose frigates were designed for convoy escort, patrol, and anti-submarine duties—the traditional frigate mission dating back centuries. Armed with two 4.5-inch guns in a twin turret, Seacat short-range SAMs, torpedo tubes, and Limbo anti-submarine mortars. The class carried a Wasp or Lynx helicopter, extending ASW reach beyond the ship's hull-mounted sonar. The ship served in the Royal Navy until 1990, later becoming CNS Almirante Lynch in the Chilean Navy. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

**HMS Andromeda (F57)** (`leander-gun-andromeda`)

Leander-class frigate commissioned in 1968. Andromeda participated in the Falklands War as part of the British task force, conducting escort and ASW duties in the Total Exclusion Zone. The ship helped defend the task force against Argentine air attacks and conducted anti-submarine patrols to prevent Argentine submarine attacks on the fleet. Armed with the standard Leander configuration of twin 4.5-inch guns, Seacat SAMs, and anti-submarine weapons. The ship was sold to India in 1995 as INS Krishna and served until 2012.

**HMS Ariadne (F72)** (`leander-gun-ariadne`)

Leander-class frigate commissioned in 1973. Ariadne served in the Falklands campaign as part of the task force providing escort duties, screening the carriers from submarine and air attack. Armed with the standard Leander configuration. Decommissioned in 1992 and sold to Chile as CNS Almirante Condell.

### Chilean Navy

**CNS Almirante Condell (PFG-06)** (`leander-gun-condell`)

Former HMS Ariadne, purchased by Chile in 1992. The ship served as a patrol frigate in the Chilean Navy, conducting sovereignty patrols along Chile's 4,300 km Pacific coastline, one of the longest coastlines in the world. Retained the Leander-class armament of 4.5-inch guns, Seacat SAMs, and anti-submarine weapons. Retired in 2007 after 34 years of combined British and Chilean service.

**CNS Almirante Lynch (PFG-07)** (`leander-gun-lynch`)

Former HMS Achilles, purchased by Chile in 1990. The ship served alongside her sister Condell in the Chilean Navy's patrol and escort role, monitoring Chile's territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. Armed with the standard Leander-class weapons fit. Decommissioned in 2003 after over 33 years of combined British and Chilean service.

## Corvettes and Patrol Vessels

### Russian Navy

**Corvette 1241.1 Molniya** (`MOLNIYA`)

Tarantul-class missile corvette (Project 1241.1 Molniya), a fast attack craft entering service from 1979. At 56 meters and 455 tons, these vessels are small but carry outsized firepower for their displacement.

The Tarantul's primary armament is four P-270 Moskit (SS-N-22 Sunburn) supersonic anti-ship missiles capable of Mach 3 flight with 300kg warheads and 120 km range. The Moskit's combination of speed and sea-skimming flight profile makes it extremely difficult to intercept, giving these small craft the ability to threaten destroyers and cruisers many times their size. Over 50 were built for the Soviet Navy and export customers including India, Poland, and Vietnam. Additional armament includes one 76mm gun, Igla (SA-18) SAM launchers for self-defense against aircraft, and one AK-630 CIWS. The high speed of 42+ knots allows rapid attack runs and evasion. The class serves in coastal defense and anti-surface strike roles, posing significant threats to larger warships in littoral waters where their small size and coastal clutter provide concealment.

**Corvette 1124M Grisha** (`ALBATROS`)

Grisha-class small anti-submarine ship (Project 1124 Albatros), entering service from 1970. At 72 meters and 1,200 tons, these corvettes were designed for coastal anti-submarine warfare in the approaches to Soviet bases in the Baltic, Black Sea, and Pacific.

Armed with 20 4K33 Osa-M (SA-N-4 Gecko) SAMs in a twin retractable launcher for air defense with 10 km range, one 76mm gun, two twin 533mm torpedo tubes, two RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launchers with 6 km range, and depth charges. The 1124M variant (Grisha III) features an improved sonar suite with bow-mounted and dipping sonars, allowing better detection of submarines in the shallow, acoustically complex littoral environment. Over 60 were built for the Soviet Navy, and the class remained in service with the Russian Navy into the 2020s.

**Patrol Ship 22160 Vasily Bykov** (`CHAP_Project22160`)

Project 22160 patrol ship (Bykov class), a new class of Russian patrol vessels entering service from 2018. At 94 meters and 1,700 tons, the class was designed for patrol, presence, and constabulary missions with modular weapon and mission bays allowing adaptation to different roles.

Armed with one 76mm gun, eight Kalibr cruise missile cells (optional modular installation), and Igla SAMs. Can embark one Ka-27 helicopter. Six ships were built for Black Sea Fleet service. The Project 22160 class has participated in Russian operations in the Black Sea and Mediterranean, including deployments during the Syrian Civil War and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

**Patrol Ship 22160 with Tor M2KM** (`CHAP_Project22160_TorM2KM`)

Variant of the Project 22160 patrol ship fitted with a containerized Tor-M2KM short-range air defense system, demonstrating the modular weapons concept envisioned for this class. The Tor-M2KM provides 16 9M338 SAMs with 12 km range and simultaneous engagement of four targets, significantly enhancing self-defense capability against aircraft, cruise missiles, and precision-guided munitions. This configuration shows how the modular mission bay can rapidly transform a patrol vessel into an air defense platform.

### Royal Navy

**Castle Class** (`CastleClass_01`)

Castle-class offshore patrol vessel, commissioned in 1981 for the Royal Navy. At 81 meters and 1,450 tons, HMS Leeds Castle and HMS Dumbarton Castle were designed for fishery protection, oil rig patrol, and sovereignty duties around the British Isles and overseas territories.

During the Falklands War, both ships served in the Total Exclusion Zone despite being intended for constabulary rather than combat roles. Their presence freed combat-capable frigates and destroyers for more demanding tasks. Armed with one 30mm gun and capable of embarking Royal Marines or carrying a Lynx helicopter on the flight deck. Both ships served until 2005 and 2007 respectively. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

## Fast Attack Craft

### French Navy / Export

**FAC La Combattante IIa** (`La_Combattante_II`)

La Combattante II-class fast attack craft, French-designed missile boats built by CMN Cherbourg and exported to numerous navies beginning in 1970. At 47 meters and 265 tons, these vessels serve as coastal defense platforms packing significant anti-ship firepower into a small hull.

Armed with four MM38 or MM40 Exocet anti-ship missiles (40-70 km range depending on variant), one 76mm OTO Melara gun, and two 40mm guns. Speed of 36+ knots allows hit-and-run tactics—the boats can dash out from coastal waters, launch missiles at larger warships, and retreat before escorts can respond effectively.

The Hellenic Navy has operated La Combattante II and IIIa variants extensively. Greek fast attack craft saw action during the 1974 Cyprus crisis, when Hellenic Navy missile boats threatened Turkish amphibious forces landing on the island. During the 1996 Imia crisis, Greek and Turkish naval forces confronted each other over disputed islets in the Aegean, with La Combattante-class boats on the front line. Exported to Greece, Iran, Libya, Malaysia, and other nations, the class demonstrated how small navies could threaten larger opponents with precision-guided anti-ship missiles.

### People's Liberation Army Navy

**Type 021-1 Missile Boat** (`Type_021_1`)

Chinese-built missile boat (Huangfeng class) based on the Soviet Osa-class design, entering service from 1966. At 38 meters and 175 tons, these small craft provided coastal defense and anti-surface strike capability in Chinese littoral waters during the Cold War.

Armed with four SY-1 (C-201/CSS-N-1 Silkworm) or later HY-2 (C-201/CSS-N-2 Safflower) anti-ship missiles with 40-95 km range depending on variant. These large missiles—essentially derived from the Soviet P-15 Styx—could sink or mission-kill frigates and destroyers with their 500kg warheads. Additional armament includes two twin 25mm guns for self-defense. Over 100 were built for the PLAN, and the class was widely exported to North Korea, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other nations seeking affordable anti-ship capability.

Similar boats saw combat during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, when Indian Osa-class boats sank Pakistani vessels at Karachi, demonstrating the lethality of missile-armed fast attack craft.

### German Navy (WWII)

**Schnellboot Type S130** (`Schnellboot_type_S130`)

German E-boat (Schnellboot) of World War II, fast torpedo boats that raided Allied convoys in the English Channel and North Sea from 1940 to 1945. Entering service from 1943, the S130-class measured 35 meters and reached speeds over 42 knots on three Daimler-Benz diesel engines.

E-boats conducted night attacks on Allied convoys, racing in at high speed, launching torpedoes, and escaping before escorts could react. Operating from bases in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, Schnellboote sank destroyers, cargo ships, and landing craft throughout the war. On the night before D-Day (5-6 June 1944), E-boats attacked the invasion fleet off Normandy, though Allied naval forces largely contained the threat. Armed with two 533mm torpedo tubes (typically four torpedoes carried), mines for offensive minelaying, one 37mm or 40mm cannon, and various 20mm automatic weapons. The S130 type represents late-war production with enhanced anti-aircraft armament to counter increasing RAF Coastal Command patrols. The wooden hulls and low silhouettes made E-boats difficult to detect by radar, and they remained a significant threat until Germany's surrender.

### Generic

**Boat Armed Hi-speed** (`speedboat`)

Generic armed speedboat representing small craft used by irregular forces, coast guards, smugglers, or naval patrol units. These fast open boats typically measure 8-12 meters and can exceed 40 knots. Armed with light weapons including machine guns and RPGs.

In DCS, represents the type of fast attack craft employed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN), which has developed "swarm" tactics using large numbers of armed speedboats to threaten larger warships in the confined waters of the Persian Gulf. Similar craft have been used by Somali pirates, Yemeni Houthi forces, and other irregular maritime actors. The small size, high speed, and low radar cross-section of these craft make them difficult to detect and engage before they can close to weapons range.

## Submarines

### Russian Navy

**SSK 877V Kilo** (`KILO`)

Project 877 Paltus diesel-electric submarine (NATO: Kilo class), entering service from 1980. At 74 meters and 3,100 tons submerged, the Kilo is renowned for extremely quiet operation when running on electric motors, earning the nickname "black hole" from Western intelligence for its low acoustic signature.

The class serves as Russia's primary conventional submarine for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare in littoral waters and chokepoints. Armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes carrying 18 torpedoes or 24 mines, with capability to launch 3M-54 Klub (SS-N-27 Sizzler) cruise missiles from torpedo tubes. The Klub provides land-attack capability to 1,500+ km or anti-ship capability with a terminal supersonic sprint that makes interception extremely difficult. Maximum depth is 300 meters with 45-day endurance.

The Kilo class has been widely exported to India, China, Iran, Algeria, Vietnam, and other nations, with over 50 built. Iranian Kilos operating in the Persian Gulf pose a significant threat to maritime traffic in the confined waters of the Strait of Hormuz. Chinese Kilos have conducted exercises rehearsing attacks on Taiwanese ports and U.S. Navy carrier groups. The quiet operation of these submarines makes them particularly dangerous in shallow littoral waters where ambient noise and bottom conditions degrade ASW sonar performance.

**SSK 636 Improved Kilo** (`IMPROVED_KILO`)

Project 636 Varshavyanka (Improved Kilo), an advanced version of the Kilo class entering service from 1997. At 74 meters and 3,950 tons submerged, this variant features significantly reduced noise levels through improved propulsion isolation, extended range of 7,500 nm at 7 knots, and enhanced combat systems.

Armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes for torpedoes, mines, or 3M-54 Kalibr (SS-N-27 Sizzler) cruise missiles. The improved Kilo remains in production for Russia and export customers.

Project 636.3 boats of the Black Sea Fleet made history on 8 December 2015, when Rostov-on-Don launched Kalibr cruise missiles from the Mediterranean against targets in Syria—the first combat cruise missile strikes from a Russian submarine since World War II. Submarines of this class have continued to conduct strikes throughout the Syrian conflict and during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, launching Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea and Mediterranean at targets in Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.

**SSK 641B Tango** (`SOM`)

Project 641B Som diesel-electric submarine (NATO: Tango class), entering service from 1973. At 91 meters and 3,900 tons submerged, these were the largest conventional submarines built by the Soviet Union, designed for extended ocean patrols tracking NATO carrier battle groups in the Atlantic and Mediterranean.

The class served as the Soviet Navy's primary conventional attack submarine before the Kilo class, operating from Polyarny in the Northern Fleet and Sevastopol in the Black Sea Fleet. Armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes carrying 24 torpedoes with capability for both anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. Maximum depth is 300 meters with 90-day endurance—far greater than most diesel submarines, allowing extended deployments trailing American carrier groups. Eighteen were built, all retired from Russian service by 1998.

### People's Liberation Army Navy

**Type 093 Attack Submarine** (`Type_093`)

Chinese nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN, Shang class), entering service from 2006. At approximately 107 meters and 7,000 tons submerged, the Type 093 represents China's second-generation nuclear attack submarine and a significant improvement over the noisy and unreliable Han class.

The class serves multiple critical roles: protecting Type 094 ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) that carry China's sea-based nuclear deterrent, attacking enemy surface ships and submarines that might threaten Chinese waters, intelligence gathering, and launching cruise missiles against land targets. Armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes for Yu-6 torpedoes and YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missiles. The YJ-18 flies subsonically at low altitude before accelerating to Mach 2.5+ for its terminal attack, making it difficult to intercept.

Later Type 093A/B variants feature improved quieting and enhanced weapons, narrowing the gap with Western nuclear attack submarines. Six to eight boats are believed in service or under construction, forming the backbone of the PLAN's nuclear attack submarine force. The Type 093 regularly operates in the South China Sea and has been tracked by the U.S. and Japanese navies in the Western Pacific.

### German Navy (WWII)

**U-boat VIIC U-flak** (`Uboat_VIIC`)

Type VIIC U-boat, the most common German submarine of World War II with over 568 built from 1940-1945. At 67 meters and 871 tons submerged, the Type VIIC formed the backbone of the Kriegsmarine's devastating submarine campaign against Allied shipping in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes (four bow, one stern) carrying 14 torpedoes, one 88mm deck gun for surface attacks, and anti-aircraft weapons. The "U-flak" designation indicates enhanced anti-aircraft armament (quadruple 20mm and 37mm cannon) added to counter the increasing threat from RAF Coastal Command patrol aircraft, particularly in the Bay of Biscay transit routes where U-boats had to surface to reach Atlantic hunting grounds.

Type VIIC boats sank millions of tons of Allied shipping in 1941-1942, coming close to severing Britain's supply lines from North America. The battle turned in mid-1943 when Allied adoption of improved sonar, centimetric radar (which U-boats could not detect), aircraft carriers, and hunter-killer groups caused U-boat losses to surge. "Black May" of 1943 saw 41 U-boats sunk, and the submarines were temporarily withdrawn from the North Atlantic. Though the campaign continued until May 1945, the Type VIIC never regained its earlier dominance. Of the 568 Type VIICs built, over 400 were lost—a casualty rate reflecting both the submarines' effectiveness and the ferocity of the Allied response.

### Argentine Navy

**ARA Santa Fe (S-21)** (`santafe`)

Former USS Catfish (SS-339), a Balao-class submarine commissioned in 1945 and transferred to Argentina in 1971. At 95 meters and 2,415 tons submerged, the Balao class was the primary American fleet submarine of late World War II, conducting the devastating submarine campaign against Japanese merchant shipping that strangled Japan's war economy.

During the Falklands War, Santa Fe was tasked with reinforcing Argentine forces on South Georgia, landing troops and supplies. On 25 April 1982, while surfaced near Grytviken, the submarine was caught by Royal Navy forces conducting Operation Paraquet to recapture South Georgia. Wessex and Lynx helicopters attacked with AS.12 missiles and depth charges, damaging the submarine's pressure hull. Unable to dive, Santa Fe was beached at King Edward Point to prevent sinking, and her crew captured. The attack provided the British with their first significant victory of the campaign and demonstrated that Argentine forces could be defeated.

Armed with ten 533mm torpedo tubes. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

## Amphibious Warfare Ships

### Russian Navy

**LS Ropucha** (`BDK-775`)

Ropucha-class large landing ship (Project 775), entering service from 1975. At 113 meters and 4,080 tons full load, these ships were designed to deliver armored forces directly onto beaches in amphibious assault operations.

Capable of carrying 10 main battle tanks and 340 troops or 24 APCs with 170 troops, the Ropucha class can beach itself on a suitable gradient, open bow doors, and allow vehicles to drive directly ashore without requiring port facilities. Over 28 were built for the Soviet Navy, and the class remains active in the Russian Navy's Black Sea, Baltic, and Northern Fleets for amphibious assault and logistics missions. Armed with two 57mm guns, two AK-630 CIWS, and Strela-3 SAM launchers.

The class has seen extensive combat operations during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. On 24 March 2022, the Alligator-class LST Saratov was destroyed by Ukrainian missiles while unloading ammunition at the occupied port of Berdyansk; the Ropucha-class ships Tsezar Kunikov and Novocherkassk were damaged in the same attack. On 14 February 2024, Tsezar Kunikov was sunk by Ukrainian Magura V5 naval drones in the Black Sea—the first large landing ship destroyed by uncrewed surface vessels. These losses demonstrated the vulnerability of amphibious ships operating within range of enemy missiles and drones.

### People's Liberation Army Navy

**Type 071 Amphibious Transport Dock** (`Type_071`)

Chinese amphibious transport dock (LPD, Yuzhao class), entering service from 2007. At 210 meters and 25,000 tons full load, these are among the largest amphibious warships outside the U.S. Navy and represent China's first modern amphibious capability.

The Type 071 serves as the command ship for PLAN amphibious ready groups, designed to project power across the Taiwan Strait and throughout the South China Sea. Capable of transporting up to 800 troops, armored vehicles, and four LCAC-type air-cushion landing craft in a well deck. The flight deck accommodates four Z-8 or Z-18 helicopters for vertical assault. Armed with one 76mm gun, four Type 630 CIWS, and HQ-10 SAM launchers for self-defense.

Eight ships serve with the PLAN and regularly participate in exercises rehearsing amphibious landings. The class has deployed to the Gulf of Aden for anti-piracy operations and participated in the evacuation of Chinese nationals from Yemen in 2015. The Type 071 forms the core of China's amphibious assault capability alongside the newer Type 075 LHD.

### United States Navy (WWII)

**LST Mk.II** (`LST_Mk2`)

Landing Ship, Tank (LST) of World War II, entering service from 1942. At 100 meters and 4,000 tons loaded, the LST was designed to solve the central problem of amphibious warfare: landing tanks and heavy vehicles directly on beaches during assault operations without requiring port facilities.

LSTs could beach themselves on a 1:50 gradient (a gentle slope), open bow doors, lower a ramp, and discharge 20 Sherman tanks or 2,100 tons of cargo directly onto the beach. This capability was revolutionary—previous amphibious operations required capturing a port intact or offloading cargo into small boats. Over 1,051 were built by U.S. shipyards in the greatest shipbuilding program of the war.

LSTs supported every major Allied amphibious operation: Sicily and Salerno in 1943, Normandy and Southern France in 1944, Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. At Normandy on D-Day, LSTs delivered the tanks and vehicles that allowed assault troops to break through beach defenses and move inland. Armed with multiple 40mm Bofors and 20mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, LSTs fought off air attacks but remained vulnerable to mines, shore batteries, and suicide boats. The unglamorous LST—nicknamed "Large Slow Target" by their crews—was essential for the "ship-to-shore" logistics that sustained amphibious campaigns. Many surplus LSTs served with Allied navies for decades postwar.

**LS Samuel Chase** (`USS_Samuel_Chase`)

USS Samuel Chase (APA-26), a Bayfield-class attack transport (APA) commissioned in 1942. At 150 meters and 16,000 tons full load, attack transports were designed to carry assault troops and their landing craft to amphibious objectives.

Attack transports carried approximately 1,500 troops and lowered up to 30 LCVPs (Higgins boats) for the initial assault waves. The ship's davits and cargo booms allowed rapid combat loading and launching of landing craft. Armed with one 5-inch gun, four 3-inch guns, and numerous 40mm and 20mm anti-aircraft weapons.

Samuel Chase participated in four major amphibious invasions: Operation Torch in North Africa (November 1942), Sicily (July 1943), Salerno (September 1943), and Normandy (June 1944). At Normandy, the ship landed troops on Omaha Beach, where they faced the fiercest German resistance of D-Day. The APA concept—combining transport, boat davits, and combat loading in a single ship—was essential to the U.S. Navy's amphibious doctrine. Chase was decommissioned in 1946.

### Generic (WWII)

**Boat LCVP Higgins** (`Higgins_boat`)

Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP), the iconic Higgins boat that carried troops ashore during World War II amphibious landings. Designed by Andrew Higgins in New Orleans, these 11-meter plywood boats with a distinctive bow ramp could carry 36 troops, a jeep with 12 men, or 3,600 pounds of cargo and land directly on beaches.

The bow ramp—which Higgins adapted from boats he designed for Louisiana trappers working in swamps—dropped forward to allow rapid disembarkation under fire. This was critical: earlier landing craft required troops to climb over the sides, exposing them to fire for precious extra seconds. Over 23,000 were built, with the Higgins boat becoming the primary first-wave assault craft for the U.S. Navy.

The LCVP saw action at every major Allied landing from North Africa to Okinawa. At Normandy, thousands of Higgins boats carried the assault waves onto five beaches. The craft were expendable—many were destroyed by mines, obstacles, and gunfire—but they delivered the infantry that won the beachheads. Armed with two .30 caliber machine guns for suppressive fire during the approach. General Eisenhower credited Higgins as "the man who won the war for us," as the LCVP solved the fundamental problem of ship-to-shore assault against defended beaches.

## Civilian and Support Vessels

### Tankers

**Tanker Seawise Giant** (`Seawise_Giant`)

The largest ship ever built, originally launched as Seawise Giant in 1979 at 458 meters long—longer than the Empire State Building is tall—with a deadweight of 564,763 tonnes. This ultra-large crude carrier (ULCC) was so large she could not transit the English Channel, Suez Canal, or Panama Canal when loaded.

During the Iran-Iraq War "Tanker War" phase (1984-1988), both sides attacked neutral oil tankers to pressure their opponent's oil exports and the international community. While anchored off Iran's Larak Island loaded with crude oil in 1988, Seawise Giant was struck by Iraqi aircraft-launched Exocet missiles. The resulting fires spread to leaked oil and blazed out of control for weeks. Though declared a total loss, the ship did not sink and was eventually salvaged and rebuilt, serving under various names as Happy Giant, Jahre Viking, and finally Knock Nevis as a floating storage unit. Scrapped in 2010.

In DCS, serves as a large civilian target or scenario element representing strategic petroleum infrastructure.

**Tanker Elnya 160** (`ELNYA`)

Soviet Type 160 coastal tanker, a common design built from the 1970s and used throughout the USSR and successor states. At approximately 100 meters and 4,000 deadweight tons, these medium-sized tankers transport refined petroleum products, fuel oil, and diesel along coastal shipping routes, between ports, and to naval anchorages for fleet resupply. In DCS, serves as civilian maritime traffic or logistics target representing coastal petroleum distribution.

### Cargo Ships

**Bulker Yakushev** (`Dry-cargo ship-1`)

Soviet-style dry cargo vessel representing common bulk carriers operating in coastal and international trade. At approximately 140 meters and 10,000 deadweight tons, this general cargo/bulk carrier transports grain, coal, ore, fertilizer, and other bulk commodities between major ports. In DCS, represents commercial shipping traffic or potential targets in maritime strike scenarios.

**Cargo Ivanov** (`Dry-cargo ship-2`)

Soviet-era general cargo ship, a smaller coaster used for coastal trade and supplying remote ports inaccessible to larger vessels. At approximately 80 meters and 2,000 deadweight tons, these ships carry general cargo, containerized goods, and break-bulk freight to secondary ports throughout the coastal network. In DCS, represents coastal shipping traffic or resupply vessels for isolated garrisons and naval facilities.

**Bulker Handy Wind** (`HandyWind`)

Handysize bulk carrier, a common class of modern commercial vessel sized (under 35,000 DWT) to enter most ports worldwide without draft restrictions. At approximately 180 meters and 28,000 deadweight tons, Handysize bulkers are the workhorses of global dry bulk trade, carrying grain, coal, ore, cement, and steel between regional ports. Equipped with deck cranes allowing cargo operations at ports lacking shore facilities. In DCS, represents modern commercial shipping operating in or transiting conflict zones.

**Supply Ship MV Tilde** (`Ship_Tilde_Supply`)

Commercial offshore supply vessel (OSV), representing the type of platform support vessel used for offshore oil and gas logistics and resupply missions. At approximately 70 meters, these vessels transport drilling supplies, pipes, chemicals, and provisions to offshore rigs and platforms. During the Falklands War, similar vessels were requisitioned as "ships taken up from trade" (STUFT) to support the British Task Force—over 50 civilian vessels were requisitioned to provide transport, hospital, repair, and logistics support. In DCS, represents civilian maritime support operations. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

### Support Craft

**Harbor Tug** (`HarborTug`)

Small harbor tug boat, typically 20-30 meters with powerful engines for its size, used for maneuvering larger vessels in confined harbor waters, assisting with docking operations, and providing emergency towing. Harbor tugs are essential port infrastructure, pushing and pulling cargo ships, tankers, and warships that cannot maneuver safely in restricted waters under their own power. In DCS, represents port operations and maritime infrastructure. Part of the South Atlantic assets.

**Boat Zvezdny type** (`ZWEZDNY`)

Soviet-designed Zvezdny-class small patrol or utility boat, a versatile craft approximately 26 meters in length used for harbor patrol, coastal transport, personnel transfer, and port security duties. These boats served throughout the Soviet naval establishment and civilian maritime organizations, providing local transport and patrol capability at naval bases and commercial ports. In DCS, represents miscellaneous small craft for harbor and coastal scenarios.
