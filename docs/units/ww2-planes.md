## A-20G

**Internal Name:** `A-20G`

**Type ID:** `A-20G`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Douglas A-20 Havoc (known as the Boston in British and Commonwealth service) was one of the most successful American attack bombers of World War II. First flying in 1938, the Havoc entered service in 1941 and quickly proved itself as a versatile platform for low-level attack, medium bombing, and night fighter roles. Over 7,400 A-20s were built, with significant numbers supplied to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease, where the type was highly regarded by Soviet aircrews.

The A-20G was the most numerous variant, with nearly 2,900 produced. It replaced the glazed bombardier nose of earlier models with a solid nose housing six forward-firing .50 caliber M2 machine guns, optimizing the aircraft for strafing and low-level attack missions. The A-20G could carry up to 4,000 pounds of bombs internally and was also fitted with underwing bomb racks for additional ordnance.

A-20s served in every theater of World War II. In the Pacific, Fifth Air Force A-20s conducted devastating low-level attacks on Japanese shipping, airfields, and ground installations. In Europe, Ninth Air Force Havocs struck bridges, rail yards, and troop concentrations in support of the Normandy invasion and subsequent ground campaign. Soviet A-20s attacked German armor, supply lines, and defensive positions on the Eastern Front. The aircraft's speed, firepower, and survivability made it a favorite among crews despite occasionally suffering heavy losses to concentrated anti-aircraft fire during low-level raids.

## B-17G

**Internal Name:** `B-17G`

**Type ID:** `B-17G`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is among the most iconic aircraft of World War II, serving as the primary American heavy bomber in the European Theater. First flying in 1935 and entering service in 1938, the B-17 was designed for the strategic bombing role and became famous for its ability to sustain tremendous battle damage while returning crews safely home. The aircraft's defensive armament of up to thirteen .50 caliber machine guns earned it the "Flying Fortress" name.

The B-17G, introduced in 1943, was the definitive production variant with over 8,600 built. The G-model added a chin turret with twin .50 caliber guns to counter the Luftwaffe's head-on attacks that had proven deadly against earlier variants. Other improvements included a staggered waist gun arrangement, enclosed waist positions, and an improved tail turret.

B-17s of the Eighth Air Force flew the daylight precision bombing campaign against Germany, striking industrial targets, transportation infrastructure, and oil production facilities. The bombing raids exacted a fearsome toll—at the campaign's peak, loss rates sometimes exceeded 10% per mission, and over 4,700 B-17s were lost in combat. Crews endured fighter attacks, intense flak barrages, and the extreme cold of high altitude over Europe. Despite the losses, B-17 formations pressed the attack, contributing significantly to the destruction of German war production and the ultimate Allied victory.

## Bf 109 K-4

**Internal Name:** `Bf 109 K-4`

**Type ID:** `Bf-109K-4`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Messerschmitt Bf 109 K-4 was the ultimate production variant of Germany's primary single-seat fighter, entering Luftwaffe service in October 1944. The K-4 represented the pinnacle of Bf 109 development, featuring a Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine with MW 50 methanol-water injection boosting output to 2,000 horsepower for short periods, improved armament with a 30mm MK 108 cannon firing through the propeller hub, and a pressurized cockpit for high-altitude combat. The K-series cleaned up the accumulated production variations of earlier models and standardized manufacturing.

The Bf 109 was the backbone of the Luftwaffe fighter force throughout World War II, with over 34,000 produced in all variants—more than any other fighter in history. The aircraft saw combat from the Spanish Civil War through the fall of Berlin, fighting in every theater from the Arctic to Africa. Bf 109 pilots accumulated the highest individual victory scores ever recorded, with over 100 pilots claiming more than 100 aerial victories each—a feat enabled by the continuous combat of the Eastern Front.

By the time the K-4 entered service, Allied air superiority was overwhelming, and the remaining Luftwaffe fighters faced hopeless odds against waves of American and British bombers escorted by long-range P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts. Fuel shortages, pilot attrition, and constant Allied attacks on airfields further degraded German capabilities. Despite the K-4's excellent performance, it came too late and in too few numbers to affect the outcome of the air war. The variant remains among the finest propeller fighters ever built.

## C-47

**Internal Name:** `C-47`

**Type ID:** `C-47`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Douglas C-47 Skytrain (known as the Dakota in British and Commonwealth service) is the military transport version of the legendary DC-3 airliner, often credited as the aircraft that made commercial aviation viable. The C-47 first delivered to the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1941 and went on to serve in every theater of World War II, carrying troops, cargo, towing gliders, and evacuating wounded personnel. General Dwight Eisenhower later named it one of the four most important tools of Allied victory, alongside the Jeep, bulldozer, and landing craft.

During World War II, C-47s dropped paratroopers over Normandy on D-Day, supplied the besieged forces at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and flew "the Hump" over the Himalayas to supply China. The Berlin Airlift of 1948-1949 saw C-47s among the aircraft delivering supplies to the blockaded city. The aircraft served in Korea and Vietnam, where AC-47 "Spooky" gunships provided devastating fire support with side-mounted miniguns.

Over 10,000 C-47s were built during the war, and the design proved so durable and versatile that examples continued flying military missions into the 21st century. Many air forces operated the type for decades after World War II, and the DC-3/C-47 family remains in limited civilian service today—over 80 years after the design first flew. The aircraft's impact on both military and commercial aviation is immeasurable.

## F4U-1D Mk.IV

**Internal Name:** `F4U-1D Mk.IV`

**Type ID:** `F4U-1D_CW`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Vought F4U-1D Corsair Mk.IV is the British Fleet Air Arm designation for the F4U-1D variant of the legendary American fighter-bomber, operated by Royal Navy squadrons from 1944 until after the war. The Fleet Air Arm was the second-largest operator of the Corsair after the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, ultimately receiving nearly 2,000 aircraft. British modifications included clipping eight inches from each wingtip to fit the lower hangar decks of British carriers—a change that actually improved roll rate slightly.

British Corsairs saw extensive combat in both the Pacific and European theaters. In the Pacific, FAA Corsairs participated in strikes against Japanese oil refineries at Palembang, Sumatra in January 1945—among the most complex carrier operations of the war. They also flew combat missions over the Japanese home islands as part of the British Pacific Fleet in 1945. In European waters, FAA Corsairs conducted strikes against the German battleship Tirpitz in Norwegian fjords. The Corsair Mk.IV specifically corresponded to the F4U-1D with its improved engine cowling for better visibility, upgraded R-2800-8W engine with water injection, and provisions for carrying bombs and rockets for ground attack missions. British pilots appreciated the Corsair's range, speed, and firepower, though carrier landings in the type remained challenging due to the long nose that obscured the deck during approach.

## F4U-1D

**Internal Name:** `F4U-1D`

**Type ID:** `F4U-1D`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Vought F4U Corsair is one of the most formidable piston-engine fighters ever built, combining exceptional performance with heavy firepower to dominate the Pacific Theater in the final years of World War II. The aircraft's distinctive inverted gull wing was designed to provide ground clearance for the massive 13-foot propeller driven by the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine—the most powerful engine fitted to a single-seat fighter at the time of its introduction. The F4U-1D variant entered service in 1944, incorporating features for the fighter-bomber role including centerline and wing hardpoints for bombs and rockets.

Initial carrier qualification problems led to the Corsair being declared unsuitable for carrier operations and assigned to Marine Corps land-based squadrons, where it quickly earned a fearsome reputation. The "Bent-Wing Bird" achieved an 11:1 kill ratio against Japanese aircraft while also proving devastatingly effective in the ground attack role. Marine and Navy Corsairs flew close air support missions across the Pacific island-hopping campaign, using rockets, bombs, and their six .50 caliber machine guns to suppress Japanese positions.

By late 1944, improved carrier landing techniques and modifications to the aircraft enabled successful carrier operations, and Corsairs increasingly flew from fleet carriers in addition to land bases. The F4U-1D added pylons capable of carrying up to 2,000 pounds of bombs or eight HVAR rockets, making it a potent fighter-bomber. The Corsair remained in production until 1953—the last piston fighter manufactured in the United States—and saw extensive combat in the Korean War, where Marine and Navy Corsairs flew close air support missions throughout the conflict. French Corsairs later fought in Indochina and during the Suez Crisis. The Corsair's combination of speed, range, firepower, and ruggedness made it one of the most successful naval fighters in history.

## Fw 190 A-8

**Internal Name:** `Fw 190 A-8`

**Type ID:** `FW-190A8`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 was one of the finest fighters of World War II, introducing a radial-engine alternative to the inline-powered Bf 109 that proved superior in many respects. Designed by Kurt Tank, the Fw 190 first flew in 1939 and entered service in 1941, immediately demonstrating superiority over the Spitfire Mk V and causing considerable alarm in RAF Fighter Command. The A-8 variant, entering production in early 1944, was the most-produced Fw 190 model and represented the ultimate development of the radial-engine series.

The Fw 190 A-8 featured the BMW 801D-2 radial engine with a water-methanol injection system for emergency power boost. Armament was formidable: four 20mm MG 151/20 cannons (two in the wing roots and two in the outer wings) plus two 13mm MG 131 machine guns above the engine, giving the aircraft devastating firepower against both bombers and fighters. The A-8 was designed specifically to counter the American heavy bomber offensive, and many were configured as Sturmbock (battering ram) attackers with additional armor protection for pressing attacks through defensive fire.

Fw 190 A-8s fought on both the Eastern and Western Fronts in the war's final year. In the Defense of the Reich campaign, A-8 pilots made head-on attacks against B-17 and B-24 formations, accepting heavy losses to bring down the bombers. The aircraft also excelled in the fighter-bomber role, attacking Allied ground forces during the Normandy campaign and Battle of the Bulge. On New Year's Day 1945, Operation Bodenplatte saw massed Fw 190 attacks on Allied airfields, destroying hundreds of aircraft on the ground. The A-8 remained in production until war's end, with over 6,500 built of this variant alone.

## Fw 190 D-9

**Internal Name:** `Fw 190 D-9`

**Type ID:** `FW-190D9`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, affectionately nicknamed "Dora-9" by its pilots, represented a radical evolution of the Fw 190 designed to counter high-altitude Allied fighters and bombers. Entering service in late 1944, the D-9 replaced the characteristic BMW 801 radial engine with a liquid-cooled Junkers Jumo 213A inline engine, dramatically improving performance at altitude where the radial-engine variants had struggled. The longer nose required a lengthened tail section for balance, giving the Dora a distinctive elongated appearance compared to earlier Fw 190s.

The D-9 restored German parity with the latest Allied fighters at high altitude, matching or exceeding the P-51D Mustang and Spitfire Mk XIV in performance. Armed with two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons and two 13mm MG 131 machine guns, the aircraft retained sufficient firepower for the fighter role while being lighter and more maneuverable than the heavily-armed A-8. Many experienced pilots considered the D-9 the finest piston-engine fighter they flew, combining excellent speed, climb rate, roll rate, and dive performance.

The Dora arrived too late and in too few numbers to significantly affect the war's outcome. Approximately 700 were built before the war's end, with production hampered by Allied bombing and material shortages. D-9 pilots flew escort for Me 262 jets during takeoff and landing when the jets were most vulnerable, and engaged in desperate defensive battles against overwhelming Allied numbers. Several elite units operated the D-9, including JG 26 and JG 54, whose pilots scored notable successes despite the hopeless strategic situation. The D-9 was intended as an interim type pending the Ta 152, but the war ended before the successor could reach significant service.

## I-16

**Internal Name:** `I-16`

**Type ID:** `I-16`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Polikarpov I-16 was a revolutionary Soviet fighter that became the world's first low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable landing gear to enter operational military service. First flying in 1933 and entering service in 1934, the I-16 (nicknamed "Ishak" or "Donkey" by Soviet pilots, and "Rata" or "Rat" by Spanish Nationalists) represented a quantum leap in fighter design, though its advanced features came with handling challenges that made it demanding to fly. The stubby, barrel-shaped fuselage and short wingspan gave the aircraft exceptional maneuverability but also made it unstable, requiring constant pilot attention.

The I-16 saw its combat debut during the Spanish Civil War from 1936, where Soviet volunteer pilots flew the type against German and Italian aircraft supporting Franco's Nationalists. The I-16 initially outperformed the Heinkel He 51 and Fiat CR.32 biplanes it faced, though the arrival of the Bf 109B began to challenge its superiority. The type also fought in the Sino-Japanese War, the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan in 1939, and the Winter War against Finland. Soviet pilots at Khalkhin Gol pioneered the use of RS-82 air-to-air rockets from I-16s.

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the I-16 equipped a significant portion of Soviet fighter aviation. Though thoroughly obsolete against the Bf 109E and Bf 109F, thousands of I-16s fought desperately during the first months of Operation Barbarossa, suffering devastating losses to superior German aircraft. Despite the carnage, I-16 pilots occasionally scored victories and flew ramming attacks (tarans) when out of ammunition. The type continued serving in secondary roles through 1943 before final retirement. Over 10,000 I-16s were built, making it one of the most-produced fighters of the prewar era.

## Ju 88 A-4

**Internal Name:** `Ju 88 A-4`

**Type ID:** `Ju-88A4`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Junkers Ju 88 was the most versatile German aircraft of World War II, serving as a level bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, heavy fighter, torpedo bomber, and reconnaissance platform. First flying in 1936 and entering service in 1939, the Ju 88 was designed as a Schnellbomber (fast bomber) capable of outrunning contemporary fighters, though this requirement was later de-emphasized in favor of heavier bomb loads. The A-4 variant represented the definitive bomber version, featuring improved defensive armament, upgraded Jumo 211J engines producing 1,340 horsepower each, and increased fuel capacity. Over 9,000 Ju 88s of all variants were produced during the war.

The Ju 88 saw action on every front where German forces fought. During the Battle of Britain in 1940, Ju 88s formed a key component of the Luftwaffe's bombing campaign, suffering lighter losses than the slower He 111 and Do 17 bombers. On the Eastern Front, the type proved effective in both level bombing and anti-shipping roles, attacking Soviet convoys and naval bases. In the Mediterranean, Ju 88s participated in the siege of Malta and anti-shipping operations that devastated Allied convoys. The aircraft's speed and maneuverability made it effective in the dive-bombing role, though it was eventually superseded by dedicated attackers in that mission. Later variants served as night fighters (the Ju 88C and G series with radar), where they achieved considerable success against RAF Bomber Command. The Ju 88's versatility meant it remained in frontline service until the end of the war, testament to the soundness of its basic design.

## Mosquito FB Mk. VI

**Internal Name:** `Mosquito FB Mk. VI`

**Type ID:** `MosquitoFBMkVI`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The de Havilland Mosquito FB Mk. VI is the most-produced fighter-bomber variant of the legendary "Wooden Wonder," entering RAF service in 1943. The FB.VI combined the nose armament of the fighter variants—four 20mm Hispano cannons and four .303 Browning machine guns—with the ability to carry two 250 lb or 500 lb bombs internally and additional ordnance on underwing racks. This devastating combination of firepower and bomb load made the FB.VI one of the most effective ground attack aircraft of World War II. Over 2,700 FB.VIs were built, more than any other Mosquito variant.

The FB.VI conducted some of the most daring precision raids of the war. RAF Mosquitos attacked Gestapo headquarters buildings across occupied Europe, including the famous raids on Amiens Prison (Operation Jericho, February 1944), the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen (Operation Carthage, March 1945), and The Hague. Coastal Command FB.VIs hunted German shipping in the North Sea and Norwegian fjords, often at mast height, using rockets and cannon fire to devastating effect. The aircraft's speed—often exceeding 380 mph at low level—made it nearly immune to interception by German fighters. FB.VIs also conducted night intruder operations over occupied Europe, hunting German night fighters and disrupting Luftwaffe operations. The Mosquito's wooden construction, initially viewed with skepticism, proved to be an advantage: it was lighter than metal, required fewer strategic materials, and gave the aircraft a smaller radar signature. The Mosquito remained in RAF service until 1955.

## P-47D-30 (Early)

**Internal Name:** `P-47D-30 (Early)`

**Type ID:** `P-47D-30bl1`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Republic P-47D-30 Thunderbolt represents initial production of the -30 block, one of the most important variants of the legendary "Jug." The -30 block introduced the bubble canopy that replaced the earlier "razorback" high-spine fuselage, dramatically improving pilot visibility in all directions. Entering service in 1944, this variant retained the massive Pratt & Whitney R-2800-59 Double Wasp radial engine producing 2,000 horsepower, giving the Thunderbolt exceptional high-altitude performance and dive speed. The Early sub-variant indicates aircraft from initial -30 production runs.

The P-47D was the most-produced variant of the Thunderbolt, with over 12,600 built out of roughly 15,600 total P-47s manufactured. The type served primarily in the European and Mediterranean Theaters, where its rugged construction, eight .50 caliber machine guns, and ability to absorb tremendous battle damage made it invaluable for both air combat and ground attack. P-47s claimed over 3,750 aerial victories in Europe while also destroying thousands of locomotives, tanks, and vehicles during strafing attacks. The Thunderbolt's ability to carry bombs and rockets made it one of the most effective fighter-bombers of the war, and its pilots developed tactics for low-level attacks that proved devastating to German ground forces during the Normandy campaign and subsequent breakout. The P-47 served with numerous Allied air forces including the RAF, Free French, Soviet, and Brazilian forces.

## P-47D-30

**Internal Name:** `P-47D-30`

**Type ID:** `P-47D-30`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Republic P-47D-30 Thunderbolt is the definitive production variant of the legendary "Jug," representing the fully mature bubble-canopy configuration that would define the Thunderbolt's iconic silhouette. Powered by the Pratt & Whitney R-2800-59 Double Wasp producing 2,000 horsepower with water injection, the P-47D-30 could reach speeds over 430 mph at altitude while carrying up to 2,500 pounds of external ordnance. The aircraft's massive size—it was the largest and heaviest single-engine fighter of the war—housed self-sealing fuel tanks, armor plating, and the turbo-supercharger that gave it outstanding high-altitude performance.

In combat, the P-47D proved extraordinarily versatile. While initially deployed as a high-altitude escort fighter, the Thunderbolt truly excelled in the ground attack role. Its eight .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns could devastate soft targets and light armor, while underwing pylons carried bombs and rockets for attacking fortified positions, bridges, and armored vehicles. P-47 pilots developed the "dive-bomb" and strafing tactics that would become standard for fighter-bomber operations. The type's legendary toughness allowed pilots to bring badly damaged aircraft home—stories abound of P-47s returning with cylinders shot off their engines or massive holes in their airframes. The Thunderbolt remained in service with various air forces well into the 1950s, and its ground attack doctrine directly influenced the development of postwar close air support tactics.

## P-47D-40

**Internal Name:** `P-47D-40`

**Type ID:** `P-47D-40`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Republic P-47D-40 Thunderbolt represents the ultimate production variant of the D-model series, incorporating all lessons learned from combat operations in Europe and the Pacific. This late-production variant featured the bubble canopy, additional underwing pylons for rockets, and provisions for the K-14 gyroscopic gunsight that dramatically improved gunnery accuracy. The -40 block could carry ten HVAR rockets in addition to bombs, making it one of the most heavily armed fighter-bombers of the war.

The P-47D-40 entered service in the final months of World War II and saw action primarily in the Pacific Theater, where its long range (extended by drop tanks) and heavy armament made it valuable for striking Japanese positions on bypassed islands and supporting amphibious operations. The type's rocket armament proved particularly effective against Japanese bunkers and fortified positions. Following the war, the P-47D-40 served with numerous air forces as American military aid, seeing combat during the Greek Civil War and with Latin American air forces. The Thunderbolt's combination of range, payload, and ruggedness made it an effective counter-insurgency and ground attack platform well into the 1950s, and the last operational P-47s were not retired until 1966 by some South American nations.

## P-51D-25-NA

**Internal Name:** `P-51D-25-NA`

**Type ID:** `P-51D`

**Playable:** Yes

### Background

The North American P-51D Mustang is widely considered the finest propeller-driven fighter of World War II, combining exceptional range, speed, and combat capability that made it the definitive American fighter of the conflict's final years. The D-model, entering service in mid-1944, introduced the distinctive bubble canopy providing dramatically improved visibility, a redesigned wing with six .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns, and the Packard V-1650-7 (license-built Rolls-Royce Merlin 66) engine producing 1,490 horsepower. The P-51D-25-NA designation indicates production at North American's Inglewood, California plant.

The P-51D's combination of range and performance revolutionized the air war over Europe. Earlier fighters could not escort bombers beyond the German border, but Mustangs could accompany B-17s and B-24s all the way to Berlin and back, breaking the Luftwaffe's ability to defend the Reich. P-51s claimed more aerial victories than any other American fighter in the European Theater, with numerous pilots becoming aces in the type. The Mustang also served in the Pacific and China-Burma-India theaters. Following World War II, P-51s flew ground attack missions during the Korean War until replaced by jets, and Mustangs continued serving in numerous air forces worldwide through the 1980s. Over 15,000 P-51s were built, and the type remains iconic in the warbird and air racing communities today.

## P-51D-30-NA

**Internal Name:** `P-51D-30-NA`

**Type ID:** `P-51D-30-NA`

**Playable:** Yes

### Background

The North American P-51D-30-NA Mustang is a late-production block incorporating refinements developed from extensive combat experience over Europe. The -30 block featured improved rocket launcher pylons that could carry six HVAR rockets in addition to the standard underwing bomb and drop tank stations, enhancing the aircraft's ground attack capability. Like all D-models, it was powered by the Packard V-1650-7 Merlin engine and armed with six .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns with increased ammunition capacity compared to earlier production blocks.

By the time the -30 block entered production in late 1944, the P-51D had established itself as the premier American fighter of the war. Mustang groups were achieving impressive kill ratios while protecting the heavy bombers on their deepest penetrations into German airspace, and the type was increasingly being used for ground attack missions as the Luftwaffe's fighter force was ground down. The P-51D-30 saw extensive service in both Europe and the Pacific, where its exceptional range allowed it to escort B-29 Superfortresses on missions from Iwo Jima to the Japanese home islands—a round trip of over 1,500 miles. Following the war, P-51Ds equipped numerous Allied air forces and saw combat in Korea, where they flew ground attack missions until replaced by jets. The Mustang remained in active service with various nations through the 1980s, and today the P-51D is the most numerous warbird type still flying.

## Spitfire LF Mk. IX CW

**Internal Name:** `Spitfire LF Mk. IX CW`

**Type ID:** `SpitfireLFMkIXCW`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. IX CW is a clipped-wing variant of Britain's iconic fighter, optimized for low-altitude operations where maneuverability and roll rate mattered more than high-altitude performance. The "CW" designation indicates clipped wings—the standard elliptical wingtips were replaced with squared-off tips reducing wingspan from 36 feet 10 inches to approximately 32 feet 2 inches. This modification improved roll rate and dive speed at the cost of some climb performance and high-altitude capability. The LF (Low-altitude Fighter) designation indicates the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 engine with a supercharger optimized for peak performance below 20,000 feet.

This configuration proved particularly valuable for anti-V-1 flying bomb operations in 1944, where Spitfires needed to intercept the fast-moving cruise missiles at low altitude. The clipped-wing Mk. IX could reach speeds of over 400 mph in a shallow dive, fast enough to catch V-1s, while its improved roll rate helped pilots maneuver into firing position or tip the flying bombs off course using their wingtips. The same characteristics made the aircraft effective for tactical reconnaissance and ground attack missions over occupied Europe, where engagements typically occurred at medium and low altitudes. Clipped-wing Spitfires served with numerous RAF squadrons during the final years of the war, operating from bases in England and the Continent as Allied forces advanced into Germany.

## Spitfire LF Mk. IX

**Internal Name:** `Spitfire LF Mk. IX`

**Type ID:** `SpitfireLFMkIX`

**Playable:** No

### Background

The Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. IX is the low-altitude optimized variant of what many consider the finest British fighter of World War II. Entering service in 1943, the Mk. IX was developed as an emergency response to the appearance of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, which had outclassed the earlier Mk. V. By mounting the more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin 61-series engine with two-stage supercharging in the Mk. V airframe, Supermarine created an aircraft that could compete with and defeat the Fw 190 at all altitudes. The LF (Low-altitude Fighter) variant used the Merlin 66 engine optimized for peak performance below 20,000 feet, producing 1,720 horsepower at lower altitudes.

The Mk. IX became the most numerous Spitfire variant, with over 5,600 produced. It served in every theater where the RAF operated, from the skies over Britain to North Africa, Italy, and the Far East. The aircraft retained the Spitfire's legendary agility while adding substantially more power and improved high-altitude performance. Armed with two 20mm Hispano cannons and four .303 Browning machine guns (or two cannons and two .50 caliber Brownings in some versions), the Mk. IX was a formidable gun platform. As the war progressed, Spitfires increasingly took on ground attack roles, carrying bombs under the wings and fuselage. The type served with numerous Allied air forces beyond the RAF, including the USAAF, Soviet VVS, Free French, and various Commonwealth nations. The Spitfire remained in RAF service until 1954 and continued flying with smaller air forces into the 1960s.

## TF-51D

**Internal Name:** `TF-51D`

**Type ID:** `TF-51D`

**Playable:** Yes

### Background

The North American TF-51D is a two-seat trainer variant of the legendary P-51D Mustang, created by converting standard single-seat fighters to dual-control configuration. The modification removed the fuselage fuel tank behind the pilot and installed a second cockpit with full flight controls, allowing experienced instructors to train new pilots on the demanding Mustang before solo flight. The USAAF used TF-51Ds during the final years of World War II and throughout the immediate postwar period for transition training as pilots moved from trainers to front-line fighters.

The Mustang's performance characteristics made transition training essential. The P-51D's power, speed, and handling differed significantly from the training aircraft new pilots had flown, and the addition of an instructor's cockpit reduced accidents during initial familiarization. The TF-51D retained combat capability and could carry weapons, though it was primarily used for training purposes. Some TF-51Ds were employed for reconnaissance and liaison duties where the second seat accommodated observers or passengers.

Today, surviving TF-51Ds are prized warbirds, offering the rare opportunity to experience Mustang flight without requiring solo proficiency in the type. The two-seat configuration makes the aircraft valuable for orientation flights, allowing passengers to experience the sensations of World War II fighter aviation from the back seat while a qualified pilot handles the demanding aircraft. Several TF-51Ds participate in airshows, commemorative flights, and warbird training programs, keeping the Mustang legacy alive for new generations. In DCS World, the TF-51D provides a free, flyable introduction to piston-engine warbird simulation without requiring the full P-51D module.
