## AH-1W

**Internal Name:** `AH-1W`

**Type ID:** `AH-1W`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only attack helicopter suitable for USMC missions from the 1980s to 2000s.

### Background

The Bell AH-1W SuperCobra is a twin-engine attack helicopter developed specifically for the United States Marine Corps. Entering service in 1986, the SuperCobra represented a major upgrade over earlier AH-1J SeaCobra variants, featuring two General Electric T700 turboshaft engines that provided improved power and survivability over the single-engine Cobras. The aircraft serves as the USMC's primary attack helicopter for close air support, anti-armor, armed escort, and fire support coordination.

The SuperCobra saw its first major combat during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, where Marine AH-1Ws flew thousands of sorties against Iraqi armor, artillery, and fortified positions. Marine Cobras destroyed over 100 tanks, 104 armored personnel carriers, and 16 bunkers during the ground campaign. The type continued operations enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq throughout the 1990s. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom), SuperCobras again provided close air support to Marine ground forces advancing toward Baghdad, engaging targets ranging from tanks to technical vehicles.

The AH-1W also deployed extensively to Afghanistan following 9/11, where its precision Hellfire missiles proved valuable for engaging Taliban and Al-Qaeda positions in mountainous terrain while minimizing collateral damage. The SuperCobra served in numerous other operations including humanitarian relief efforts and showed its versatility in both conventional and counterinsurgency warfare. The USMC began replacing the AH-1W with the four-blade AH-1Z Viper starting in 2010, though SuperCobras remained in frontline service through the mid-2010s.

## AH-64A

**Internal Name:** `AH-64A`

**Type ID:** `AH-64A`

**Playable:** No

**Deprecated:** Yes — superseded by AH-64D BLK.II

**Usage Notes:** AI-only Apache variant suitable for missions from the late Cold War through early 2000s.

### Background

The Boeing AH-64A Apache is the original production variant of the Apache attack helicopter, entering U.S. Army service in 1986. Developed during the 1970s to replace the AH-1 Cobra in the anti-armor role, the Apache was designed to destroy Soviet tank formations on a Cold War European battlefield. The helicopter features a 30mm M230 chain gun mounted under the nose, can carry up to 16 AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles or 76 Hydra 70 rockets, and uses the Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (TADS/PNVS) for all-weather day and night operations.

The Apache received its baptism of fire during Operation Just Cause in Panama (1989), where AH-64As attacked Panamanian Defense Force positions. Its defining moment came during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. On 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As from the 101st Airborne Division launched the opening attack of the Gulf War, destroying two Iraqi early warning radar sites and creating a corridor for coalition aircraft to enter Iraqi airspace. During the subsequent ground war, Apache units devastated Iraqi armored formations, with Army aviation claiming destruction of over 500 tanks, 120 armored personnel carriers, and hundreds of other vehicles. The Apache's ability to fight at night and in adverse weather proved decisive against an enemy that lacked comparable capabilities.

Following Desert Storm, AH-64As deployed for peacekeeping operations in the Balkans during the 1990s and supported combat operations in Afghanistan after 9/11. The type was gradually replaced by the AH-64D Apache Longbow beginning in the late 1990s, though AH-64As continued in National Guard service and with numerous export customers including Egypt, Greece, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

## AH-64D

**Internal Name:** `AH-64D`

**Type ID:** `AH-64D`

**Playable:** No

**Deprecated:** Yes — superseded by AH-64D BLK.II

**Usage Notes:** AI-only Apache Longbow variant for missions from the 1990s onward.

### Background

The Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbow is an advanced variant featuring the distinctive AN/APG-78 Longbow fire control radar mounted above the main rotor. Entering U.S. Army service in 1995, the Longbow Apache represented a revolutionary leap in attack helicopter capability. The millimeter-wave radar enables the helicopter to detect, classify, and prioritize up to 128 targets simultaneously while remaining masked behind terrain, then rapidly engage up to 16 targets with fire-and-forget AGM-114L Longbow Hellfire missiles. This allows Apache Longbow crews to pop up from cover, acquire targets in seconds, launch missiles, and drop back to safety before the enemy can react.

The AH-64D saw extensive combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. On the night of 24 March 2003, 33 Apaches from the 11th Aviation Regiment attacked Republican Guard positions near Karbala in one of the largest helicopter assaults since Vietnam. The Iraqis had prepared an elaborate ambush, turning off all lights in the city as a signal for concentrated anti-aircraft fire. Nearly every Apache was hit; one was shot down and its crew captured (later rescued), and many others were so badly damaged they could not fly for weeks. Despite this setback, Apaches adapted their tactics and proved highly effective during the remainder of the campaign and subsequent counterinsurgency operations.

Apache Longbows served throughout the Iraq War and continue operating in Afghanistan and other theaters. The type has been exported to the United Kingdom (as the WAH-64D), Japan, Singapore, and other allies. Israel's AH-64Ds have seen extensive combat against Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The Longbow Apache established the paradigm for modern attack helicopter operations, demonstrating that the combination of sensors, networking, and precision weapons can dominate the land battlefield.

## AH-64D BLK.II

**Internal Name:** `AH-64D BLK.II`

**Type ID:** `AH-64D_BLK_II`

**Playable:** Yes

**Supersedes:** AH-64A, AH-64D

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module with fully modeled systems including TADS/PNVS and Longbow radar.

### Background

The AH-64D Block II Apache is the definitive production variant of the Longbow Apache, entering U.S. Army service in the mid-2000s. Block II Apaches feature an improved glass cockpit with digital displays replacing analog instruments, enhanced digital systems for better reliability and maintainability, and the revolutionary ability to control and receive video feeds from unmanned aerial systems such as the MQ-1C Gray Eagle. This manned-unmanned teaming capability allows Apache crews to see over the horizon using drone sensors, dramatically extending their situational awareness.

The Block II Apache incorporates lessons learned from a decade of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Crews flying earlier Apaches found that counterinsurgency operations required different tactics than the Cold War anti-armor mission the helicopter was designed for. Block II improvements enhance target identification capabilities crucial for minimizing civilian casualties, while improved communications and data-sharing allow better coordination with ground forces. The integration of the Joint Tactical Radio System and Link 16 datalink enables Apache crews to share targeting data across the joint force in real time.

Block II Apaches continue the type's combat legacy, deploying to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and other theaters. The Apache has become the U.S. Army's primary attack helicopter and will remain in service for decades. Export Block II Apaches serve with numerous allied nations. In DCS, the Block II represents the high-fidelity player-flyable Apache module, featuring realistic systems modeling including the TADS/PNVS, Longbow radar, and comprehensive weapons systems.

## CH-47D

**Internal Name:** `CH-47D`

**Type ID:** `CH-47D`

**Playable:** No

**Deprecated:** Yes — superseded by CH-47F

**Usage Notes:** AI-only heavy transport helicopter.

### Background

The Boeing CH-47D Chinook is a tandem-rotor heavy-lift helicopter that has served as the backbone of U.S. Army aviation since the 1960s. The original CH-47A first flew in 1961 and entered service in 1962, with the improved D model introduced in 1982 featuring upgraded T55-L-712 turboshaft engines, fiberglass rotor blades, and modernized avionics. The Chinook can carry up to 33 combat-equipped troops internally or sling-load up to 26,000 pounds of external cargo, making it indispensable for moving artillery, vehicles, and supplies.

The Chinook earned its reputation during the Vietnam War, where CH-47s performed extraordinary feats of logistics and combat rescue. Chinooks recovered downed aircraft from jungle landing zones, inserted and extracted special operations forces, delivered ammunition to firebase artillery, and transported casualties to field hospitals. The helicopter's ability to operate in hot, high-altitude conditions proved crucial. Over 750 Chinooks deployed to Vietnam, and the type flew millions of sorties despite significant combat losses.

The CH-47D saw extensive service in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, moving troops and equipment across the Saudi desert and into Kuwait. During operations in Afghanistan—where mountain altitudes often exceed 10,000 feet—the Chinook's power reserves made it one of the few helicopters capable of sustained high-altitude operations. CH-47s have supported every major U.S. military operation since Vietnam and serve with armed forces worldwide. The type remains in production as the CH-47F, ensuring the Chinook will continue flying for decades to come.

### Background

The Boeing CH-47F Chinook is the latest production variant of the Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, entering U.S. Army service in 2007. The F-model represents a comprehensive modernization of the venerable Chinook design, featuring a Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) digital glass cockpit, upgraded T55-GA-714A engines providing 4,868 shaft horsepower each, and a completely redesigned airframe with improved corrosion resistance and fatigue life. The CH-47F can carry up to 55 troops or sling-load up to 26,000 pounds of cargo, maintaining the heavy-lift capability that has made the Chinook indispensable for over six decades.

The CH-47F incorporates extensive combat lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq. Improved avionics reduce crew workload, allowing pilots to focus on threats during approaches to hot landing zones. The digital flight control system enhances stability during hover operations, critical for sling-load work and brownout landings. Enhanced survivability features include improved self-sealing fuel tanks and infrared suppression systems. The F-model's redesigned airframe extends service life to enable the Chinook to remain operational into the 2060s.

CH-47Fs have deployed extensively to Afghanistan, where the type's ability to operate at high altitudes under hot conditions makes it essential for operations in mountain valleys. The helicopters routinely resupply remote outposts inaccessible to ground vehicles and extract casualties from forward positions. Special operations variants (MH-47G) conduct clandestine insertions and extractions. The CH-47F serves with numerous allied nations and remains in production, with Block II upgrades adding further capability. In DCS, a separate high-fidelity player module is available in addition to this AI variant.

## CH-53E

**Internal Name:** `CH-53E`

**Type ID:** `CH-53E`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only heavy transport helicopter for amphibious operations.

### Background

The Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion is the largest and heaviest helicopter in the United States military inventory. Entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps in 1981, this three-engine heavy-lift helicopter was developed specifically for shipboard operations, enabling the Marines to lift heavy equipment from amphibious assault ships directly to shore. With three General Electric T64-GE-416 turboshaft engines generating 13,140 shaft horsepower, the Super Stallion can carry up to 16 tons of external cargo—enough to lift downed aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery pieces, and ammunition pallets.

The CH-53E has served in every major U.S. military operation since its introduction. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Super Stallions moved vast quantities of supplies and equipment to support Marine ground forces advancing into Kuwait. The type performed critical mine countermeasures work using the MH-53E Sea Dragon variant, clearing shipping lanes and harbors of Iraqi mines. In Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, CH-53Es provided heavy-lift capability essential for sustained operations in austere environments, moving equipment that no other helicopter in the Western inventory could handle.

The Super Stallion's shipboard compatibility makes it invaluable for expeditionary operations. The helicopter's main and tail rotors fold for storage aboard amphibious ships, and the aircraft routinely operates from LHD and LHA flight decks in challenging sea states. CH-53Es have supported humanitarian relief efforts worldwide, including disaster response and non-combatant evacuation operations. The type is being replaced by the CH-53K King Stallion, which entered service in 2022 with significantly improved lift capacity and modern avionics, though the Super Stallion will continue flying into the late 2020s.

## Ka-27

**Internal Name:** `Ka-27`

**Type ID:** `Ka-27`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only naval helicopter for ship-based operations.

### Background

The Kamov Ka-27 (NATO reporting name "Helix") is a Soviet/Russian naval helicopter that entered service in 1982 as the primary shipboard rotorcraft for the Soviet Navy. The helicopter features Kamov's trademark coaxial contra-rotating rotor system, which eliminates the need for a tail rotor and produces a remarkably compact footprint ideal for operation from the cramped flight decks of destroyers, frigates, and cruisers. The Ka-27 replaced the earlier Ka-25 Hormone and was designed specifically for anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and utility transport missions.

The Ka-27PL anti-submarine variant carries dipping sonar, sonobuoys, torpedoes, and depth charges for detecting and attacking submarines. The type operates from virtually every major Soviet and Russian surface combatant, extending the ship's ASW reach far beyond hull-mounted sonar range. The Ka-27PS serves as the search and rescue and utility variant, while the Ka-29TB is an assault transport version armed with rockets and machine guns for supporting amphibious operations.

Ka-27s have deployed with the Russian Navy worldwide, operating from vessels in the Mediterranean, Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic. Indian Navy Ka-28s (export designation) operate from Delhi-class destroyers and have participated in anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden. Chinese Navy Ka-28s serve aboard Type 052 and Type 051C destroyers. The helicopter remains in frontline service with the Russian Navy aboard Admiral Kuznetsov, Kirov-class battlecruisers, and numerous other vessels, though Russia is developing the Ka-52K Katran as a future replacement for shipboard attack helicopter roles.

## Ka-50

**Internal Name:** `Ka-50`

**Type ID:** `Ka-50`

**Playable:** Yes

**Deprecated:** Yes — superseded by Ka-50 III

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module. The original Black Shark module with authentic systems modeling.

### Background

The Kamov Ka-50 "Chernaya Akula" (Black Shark) is a distinctive single-seat Russian attack helicopter featuring Kamov's trademark coaxial contra-rotating rotors. First flying in 1982 and entering limited service in 1995, the Ka-50 was designed primarily for anti-tank warfare on a Cold War European battlefield. The single-seat configuration was revolutionary and controversial—Western attack helicopters universally use two-person crews—and relied on automated systems to reduce pilot workload. The helicopter features the Shkval optical targeting system with television and laser channels, up to 12 9K121 Vikhr laser-guided anti-tank missiles, a 30mm Shipunov 2A42 autocannon, and an ejection system unique among helicopters.

The Ka-50 saw limited combat during the Second Chechen War in 2000-2001, deploying to the North Caucasus for operational evaluation. Two Ka-50s conducted combat trials, engaging Chechen targets with Vikhr missiles and rockets. The trials demonstrated the aircraft's combat capability but also revealed that the single-pilot workload was excessive in high-intensity scenarios, leading to development of the two-seat Ka-52 Alligator variant.

Only a small number of Ka-50s were produced—approximately 10-15 aircraft—before production shifted to the Ka-52. The Black Shark remains in Russian service in limited numbers and has been used for training and development. Despite its limited production, the Ka-50 pioneered technologies and design concepts that matured in the Ka-52, which has become Russia's primary attack helicopter. The coaxial rotor system provides exceptional maneuverability and eliminates tail rotor vulnerability, while the K-37-800 ejection system—which blows off the rotor blades before firing the seat—offers survivability unmatched by any other helicopter. In DCS, the Ka-50 is one of the high-fidelity modules, offering authentic flight modeling and systems simulation.

## Mi-24P

**Internal Name:** `Mi-24P`

**Type ID:** `Mi-24P`

**Playable:** Yes

**Supersedes:** Mi-24V

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module with authentic Hind systems and weapons.

### Background

The Mil Mi-24P (NATO reporting name "Hind-F") is a heavily armed Soviet attack helicopter that entered service in 1981 as the definitive gun-armed variant of the Mi-24 family. The P-model replaced the flexible four-barrel 12.7mm YakB machine gun of earlier Hinds with a fixed twin-barrel 30mm GSh-30K cannon mounted on the right side of the fuselage, providing devastating firepower against armored vehicles, fortifications, and personnel. The Mi-24 uniquely combines the firepower of a dedicated attack helicopter with the troop-carrying capacity of a transport, accommodating eight combat-equipped soldiers in its passenger cabin—earning it the nickname "Krokodil" (Crocodile) or "flying BMP."

The Mi-24 saw its first major combat during the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), where Hinds became the iconic image of Soviet military power. Mi-24s provided close air support, armed escort for transport helicopters, and attacked mujahideen positions in mountain valleys. Afghan fighters came to fear the "Shaitan-Arba" (Satan's Chariot), and the introduction of American Stinger missiles to counter the Hind became a turning point in the conflict. Despite losses to MANPADs, Mi-24s proved highly effective in counterinsurgency operations.

The Hind has seen combat on nearly every continent. Iraqi Mi-24s fought in the Iran-Iraq War. Ethiopian and Eritrean Hinds clashed during their border conflict. Russian Mi-24s conducted operations in both Chechen Wars and in Syria. The type has been exported to over 50 countries, making it one of the most widely deployed attack helicopters in history. In DCS, the Mi-24P is a high-fidelity module featuring authentic systems modeling and the characteristic Hind flight dynamics.

## Mi-24V

**Internal Name:** `Mi-24V`

**Type ID:** `Mi-24V`

**Playable:** No

**Deprecated:** Yes — superseded by Mi-24P

**Usage Notes:** AI-only Hind variant for Soviet/Russian and export operator missions.

### Background

The Mil Mi-24V (NATO reporting name "Hind-E") is the most widely produced variant of the Mi-24 family, entering service with Soviet forces in 1976. The V-model introduced the improved USPU-24 chin turret mounting the four-barrel 12.7mm YakB-12.7 rotary machine gun, capable of 4,000 rounds per minute. More significantly, the Mi-24V was the first variant to carry the 9M114 Shturm (NATO: AT-6 Spiral) radio-command guided anti-tank missile, providing standoff capability against armored vehicles at ranges up to 5 kilometers.

The Mi-24V bore the brunt of Soviet helicopter operations in Afghanistan. Hinds flew thousands of sorties supporting ground forces, striking mujahideen caravans, providing armed escort for Mi-8 transports, and inserting spetsnaz teams into mountain positions. Soviet pilots developed innovative tactics to deal with the threat from MANPADS, including high-speed attack runs and coordinated flights with electronic warfare aircraft. The chaff and flare dispensers fitted to Mi-24Vs became essential for survival as Stingers proliferated among Afghan resistance fighters.

The Mi-24V has served with Soviet successor states and export customers worldwide. Iraqi Hinds saw extensive combat during the Iran-Iraq War, engaging Iranian ground forces and even achieving air-to-air kills against Iranian helicopters. Syrian Mi-24Vs have operated throughout the civil war that began in 2011, conducting strikes against opposition forces. The type remains in service with numerous nations and has proven remarkably adaptable to different combat environments and threat conditions.

## Mi-26

**Internal Name:** `Mi-26`

**Type ID:** `Mi-26`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only heavy transport helicopter.

### Background

The Mil Mi-26 (NATO reporting name "Halo") is the largest and most powerful helicopter ever to have gone into serial production. First flying in 1977 and entering Soviet service in 1983, this massive rotorcraft was designed to transport ballistic missiles, armored vehicles, and other heavy equipment that exceeded the lift capacity of the Mi-6 it replaced. Powered by two Lotarev D-136 turboshaft engines producing 11,400 shaft horsepower each, the Mi-26 can carry 20 tons of internal cargo in its hold—equivalent to a C-130 transport aircraft—or sling-load external cargo of similar weight. The cavernous cabin can accommodate 90 combat-equipped troops or 60 stretcher cases with medical attendants.

The Mi-26 has proven invaluable for heavy-lift missions in austere environments. During Soviet operations in Afghanistan, Mi-26s moved heavy equipment to remote mountain bases inaccessible by road. Following the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Mi-26s dropped sand, boron, and lead onto the burning reactor to contain radioactive contamination. Russian Mi-26s have supported operations in Chechnya and Syria, moving equipment and supplies for expeditionary forces.

The type has found civilian applications in logging, construction, and disaster relief, lifting loads that no other helicopter can handle. An Mi-26 famously transported a frozen woolly mammoth carcass from Siberian permafrost to a research facility. The helicopter has been exported to numerous nations and is available for contract heavy-lift work worldwide. Despite its size, the Mi-26 requires only a crew of five, though operational missions typically carry additional loadmasters and flight engineers. India operates Mi-26s at extreme altitudes in the Himalayas, demonstrating the type's power reserves even in demanding hot-and-high conditions.

## Mi-28N [CH]

**Internal Name:** `Mi-28N [CH]`

**Type ID:** `Mi-28N`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only modern Russian attack helicopter.

### Background

The Mil Mi-28N "Nochnoy Okhotnik" (Night Hunter, NATO reporting name "Havoc-B") is a Russian all-weather, day-night attack helicopter that entered service in 2009. Development began in the 1980s as a conventional tandem-seat attack helicopter to complement the single-seat Ka-50, but funding constraints delayed production until the 2000s. The Mi-28N features a distinctive mast-mounted N025 radar for terrain following, obstacle avoidance, and target detection in adverse weather, along with the GOES-451 electro-optical system providing thermal imaging and laser designation capability.

The Mi-28N was designed to address the limitations revealed by the Ka-50's single-seat configuration. The two-person crew—pilot and weapons systems operator—divides workload between flying and fighting, proven essential in high-intensity combat. The helicopter's design emphasizes survivability with armored crew stations, self-sealing fuel tanks, redundant systems, and energy-absorbing landing gear capable of surviving crash landings at high descent rates.

The Mi-28N saw its combat debut during Russian operations in Syria beginning in 2015, where Night Hunters provided close air support for Syrian government forces and attacked ISIS and other opposition targets. The helicopter's all-weather capability proved valuable for sustained operations, and Ataka missiles demonstrated effective precision strike against vehicles and fortifications. Russian Mi-28Ns also deployed during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, though the type has suffered significant losses to Ukrainian air defenses, particularly MANPADs and medium-range SAM systems. Iraq has operated export Mi-28NE helicopters against ISIS forces, using the type for night operations that the enemy could not counter. The Mi-28N is now Russia's primary attack helicopter alongside the Ka-52.

**Type ID:** `Mi-8MT`

**Playable:** Yes

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module with authentic Hip systems, weapons, and flight model.

### Background

The Mil Mi-8MTV2 (NATO reporting name "Hip-H") is an upgraded variant of the venerable Mi-8 transport helicopter, featuring more powerful TV3-117VM turboshaft engines and improved avionics for all-weather operations. The Mi-8 family has been produced in greater numbers than any other helicopter in history—over 17,000 built since 1961—and serves in military and civilian roles in more than 80 countries worldwide.

The Mi-8 earned its reputation in Afghanistan, where Soviet Hip transports flew countless missions delivering troops, supplies, and casualties through hostile mountain valleys. The helicopter proved rugged and maintainable in austere conditions, surviving damage that would have downed lesser aircraft. Armed versions carried rocket pods and machine guns for suppressive fire during insertions into hot landing zones. The Mi-8's ability to operate from high-altitude forward operating bases made it indispensable for the Soviet campaign.

The MTV2 variant, entering service in the 1990s, incorporated lessons from Afghanistan and Chechnya. The upgraded engines provide additional power margins for hot-and-high operations, while improved avionics include weather radar, GPS navigation, and enhanced communication systems. The helicopter can carry up to 24 troops or 4 tons of internal cargo, and retains capability for armament including rocket pods, bombs, and door-mounted machine guns.

Russian Mi-8MTVs have deployed to Syria and Ukraine, providing transport and fire support. The type serves with former Soviet republics, China, India, and numerous other nations in both military and civilian configurations. In DCS, the Mi-8MTV2 is a high-fidelity module offering authentic Hip flight dynamics and systems simulation.

## OH-58D

**Internal Name:** `OH-58D`

**Type ID:** `OH-58D`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only scout helicopter.

### Background

The Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior is an armed reconnaissance helicopter developed from the earlier OH-58A/C Kiowa scout helicopter under the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). Entering service in 1985, the OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast Mounted Sight (MMS)—a spherical sensor turret mounted above the main rotor containing television, thermal imaging, and laser designator/rangefinder systems. This configuration allows the Kiowa to observe and designate targets while remaining concealed behind terrain with only the sensor ball exposed, a tactic pioneered in response to the increasing lethality of anti-aircraft systems.

The OH-58D first saw combat during Operation Prime Chance in 1987-1988, when specially modified Kiowa Warriors conducted night attacks against Iranian vessels laying mines in the Persian Gulf during the Tanker War. Armed with Hellfire missiles and .50 caliber machine guns, OH-58Ds destroyed or damaged numerous Iranian speedboats and small craft. The type subsequently deployed to Panama, the Gulf War, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, demonstrating remarkable versatility across two decades of operations.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, Kiowa Warrior teams became essential for reconnaissance and close air support of ground forces. The helicopter's small size, agility, and relatively low operating costs made it ideal for sustained presence over the battlefield. OH-58D crews developed close relationships with ground units, providing overwatch and engaging targets with rockets, Hellfires, and machine guns. The type was officially retired from U.S. Army service in 2017, replaced by a combination of AH-64E Apaches and unmanned systems, though it remains in service with some allied nations.

## OH-58D(R)

**Internal Name:** `OH-58D(R)`

**Type ID:** `OH58D`

**Playable:** Yes

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module with full Kiowa Warrior systems modeling.

### Background

The OH-58D(R) Kiowa Warrior represents the definitive production version of the armed reconnaissance helicopter, incorporating upgrades developed through decades of operational experience. The (R) designation indicates a retrofit standard applied to earlier OH-58D airframes, incorporating improved avionics, enhanced survivability features, and expanded weapons capability including compatibility with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, 2.75-inch rockets (including laser-guided APKWS), and the .50 caliber M3P machine gun.

The Kiowa Warrior's operational concept centered on the scout-weapons team, pairing OH-58Ds with AH-64 Apaches in hunter-killer formations. The nimble Kiowa would scout ahead, detect targets using its Mast Mounted Sight while hiding behind terrain, then either engage with its own weapons or hand off targeting data to the heavier Apache. This teamwork allowed efficient use of the Apache's greater firepower while exploiting the Kiowa's superior agility and lower operating costs.

OH-58D(R) crews became masters of low-level reconnaissance and precision attack. In counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Kiowa teams provided persistent overwatch for ground convoys and patrols, engaging insurgent ambushes and IED-emplacement teams. The small helicopter could operate from confined forward arming and refueling points close to the action, responding rapidly to troops in contact. Though the type was retired from U.S. Army service in 2017, the Kiowa Warrior's tactics and techniques informed the development of future Army aviation concepts. In DCS, the OH-58D(R) is the high-fidelity player-flyable module featuring full systems modeling including the Mast Mounted Sight for target acquisition and laser designation.

## SA342L

**Internal Name:** `SA342L`

**Type ID:** `SA342L`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** This entry represents the AI variant. Flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

### Background

The Aérospatiale SA 342L Gazelle is a light scout and utility helicopter of French origin. First flying in 1967 and entering service in 1973, the Gazelle was developed as a successor to the Alouette series and introduced several innovative features including the distinctive fenestron shrouded tail rotor—a ducted fan design that reduces noise, improves safety around ground personnel, and provides better tail rotor efficiency in crosswind conditions. The L variant is an export model featuring the Astazou XIV engine with improved hot-and-high performance and compatibility with a variety of armament options.

The Gazelle has seen extensive combat service with numerous operators. British Army Gazelles deployed to the Falklands War in 1982, providing reconnaissance and light transport despite losses to Argentine ground fire. French Gazelles armed with HOT missiles served in Chad during operations against Libyan forces in the 1980s. Syrian Gazelles engaged Israeli forces during the 1982 Lebanon War. Iraqi Gazelles saw action during the Iran-Iraq War and the Gulf War, with some captured by coalition forces. Yugoslav Gazelles operated during the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s.

The SA 342L's light weight and agility make it well-suited for reconnaissance, observation, and light attack missions in environments where larger attack helicopters would be too conspicuous or expensive to operate. The helicopter can be armed with rockets, machine gun pods, or Mistral air-to-air missiles for self-defense and light air defense duties. Over 1,200 Gazelles were produced, and the type remains in service with armed forces in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

## SA342M

**Internal Name:** `SA342M`

**Type ID:** `SA342M`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** This entry represents the AI variant. Flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

### Background

The Aérospatiale SA 342M Gazelle is the French Army (ALAT) variant specifically developed as a light anti-tank helicopter. The M-model entered service in 1980 armed with the Euromissile HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé) wire-guided anti-tank missile system, with four missiles carried on outrigger pylons. The crew of two—pilot and gunner—engage targets using a roof-mounted APX M397 gyro-stabilized sight that provides magnified optics for target acquisition and missile guidance.

The SA 342M saw combat during French operations in Chad during the 1980s, where Gazelles armed with HOT missiles engaged Libyan armor during the "Toyota War" and subsequent interventions. French Army Gazelles also deployed to Lebanon, the Gulf War, Kosovo, and numerous African peacekeeping operations. The combination of the Gazelle's agility and the HOT missile's precision made it effective against armored vehicles in environments ranging from desert to mountain terrain.

The HOT system's wire-guidance requires the helicopter to maintain line-of-sight throughout the missile's flight, typically 15-20 seconds to maximum range—a vulnerability that later systems with fire-and-forget capability addressed. However, the relatively low cost of the Gazelle compared to dedicated attack helicopters like the Apache made it an economical solution for nations requiring anti-tank helicopter capability. The SA 342M served as the French Army's primary anti-tank helicopter until replaced by the Eurocopter Tiger, though Gazelles remained in service for training and secondary roles. In DCS, the SA 342M is flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

## SA342Minigun

**Internal Name:** `SA342Minigun`

**Type ID:** `SA342Minigun`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** This entry represents the AI variant. Flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

### Background

The SA 342 Minigun represents a Gazelle variant configured for fire suppression and light attack missions, equipped with a side-mounted M134 minigun—the six-barrel 7.62mm rotary weapon capable of firing up to 6,000 rounds per minute. This configuration reflects the adaptation of the Gazelle platform for counterinsurgency and security operations where the primary targets are personnel, unarmored vehicles, and light structures rather than tanks.

This armament configuration has been employed by various Gazelle operators who modified their aircraft for specific operational requirements. The minigun's high rate of fire provides devastating suppressive capability for escort missions, landing zone preparation, or covering troop insertions and extractions. The relatively light weight of the 7.62mm ammunition allows the Gazelle to carry substantial ammunition loads despite its small size.

The trade-off for this firepower is the complete sacrifice of anti-armor capability. Without HOT missiles or rockets, the minigun-armed Gazelle cannot engage armored vehicles or fortified positions effectively. This makes the variant highly specialized for environments where air defense threats are minimal and the opposition consists primarily of irregular forces. In DCS, the SA 342 Minigun is flyable as part of the Gazelle module, offering a different tactical capability than the HOT-armed variants.

## SA342Mistral

**Internal Name:** `SA342Mistral`

**Type ID:** `SA342Mistral`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** This entry represents the AI variant. Flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

### Background

The SA 342 Mistral is a Gazelle variant armed with Mistral infrared-homing air-to-air missiles for helicopter self-defense and light air defense duties. The Mistral (Missile Transportable Léger Anti-aérien) is a French-developed short-range air-to-air missile originally designed as a man-portable surface-to-air missile, adapted for helicopter use with the ATAM (Air-to-Air Mistral) launcher system. The missile homes on infrared emissions from target aircraft or helicopters, achieving kills at ranges up to 6 kilometers.

The Mistral-armed Gazelle emerged from recognition that light helicopters operating in contested environments required some means of self-defense against enemy rotorcraft. While not intended to compete with dedicated attack helicopters in the air-to-air role, the Mistral provides a credible deterrent against opposing scout and transport helicopters. French Army Gazelles in the Celtic system paired Mistral-armed helicopters with HOT-armed variants, with the former providing top cover against air threats while the latter engaged ground targets.

This configuration has limited ground attack capability, relying primarily on the Mistral missiles for engaging aerial targets. The role is highly specialized—providing helicopter air defense and escort for vulnerable transport formations. In environments where enemy helicopters pose a threat, the Mistral Gazelle provides a cost-effective counter. In DCS, the SA 342 Mistral is flyable as part of the Gazelle module.

## SH-3W

**Internal Name:** `SH-3W`

**Type ID:** `SH-3W`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only naval helicopter for carrier operations.

### Background

The Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King is an amphibious twin-engine helicopter that served as the U.S. Navy's primary carrier-based anti-submarine warfare platform from 1961 until its replacement by the SH-60 Seahawk in the 1990s. The Sea King pioneered shipboard helicopter ASW operations, carrying dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and torpedoes to detect and attack submarines far from the carrier. Its amphibious hull allows water landings, though this capability was rarely used operationally.

The SH-3 is perhaps best known to the public for its role in the Apollo program, recovering astronauts and their capsules after Pacific Ocean splashdowns from 1961 to 1975. President Nixon greeted the Apollo 11 astronauts aboard an SH-3 following the first moon landing. Sea Kings also served as VIP transports, with Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) operating VH-3D variants as Marine One, the presidential helicopter.

The W variant represents an airborne early warning and reconnaissance configuration, equipped with radar systems to extend the ship's detection range against low-flying aircraft and sea-skimming missiles. This capability proved valuable for protecting carrier battle groups from anti-ship missile attack, providing warning time for defensive systems to engage. The Sea King has served with over a dozen navies worldwide, with many continuing operations into the 21st century. The Royal Navy operated Sea Kings until 2018, and the type remains in service with several nations for search and rescue, transport, and utility missions.

## SH-60B

**Internal Name:** `SH-60B`

**Type ID:** `SH-60B`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only naval helicopter for anti-submarine and utility missions.

### Background

The Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk is the U.S. Navy's primary shipboard helicopter, entering service in 1984 as part of the LAMPS III (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) program to replace the aging SH-2 Seasprite. Derived from the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk but extensively modified for maritime operations, the Seahawk features folding main rotor blades and tail pylon for storage in destroyer and cruiser hangars, reinforced landing gear for shipboard operations, and corrosion-resistant materials for the salt-water environment.

The SH-60B serves as the primary anti-submarine warfare helicopter for Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Ticonderoga-class cruisers, extending the ship's sensor reach far beyond hull-mounted sonar range. The helicopter carries the AN/APS-124 search radar, AN/ASQ-81 magnetic anomaly detector, and can deploy sonobuoys to detect and track submarines. For attack, the Seahawk carries Mk 46 or Mk 50 lightweight torpedoes. The type also performs anti-surface warfare using the AGM-119 Penguin anti-ship missile and can conduct search and rescue, medical evacuation, and vertical replenishment missions.

Seahawks have deployed with U.S. Navy surface combatants worldwide since the 1980s. During the Persian Gulf tanker escort operations of 1987-1988, SH-60Bs conducted surveillance and tracked Iranian naval movements. The type has served in virtually every U.S. naval operation since, including Desert Storm, operations in the Balkans, counter-piracy patrols off Somalia, and ongoing deployments in the Western Pacific and Middle East. The multi-mission helicopter has proven invaluable for extending the eyes and weapons of surface combatants.

## UH-1H

**Internal Name:** `UH-1H`

**Type ID:** `UH-1H`

**Playable:** Yes

**Usage Notes:** High-fidelity player module. The iconic Huey with authentic flight dynamics and systems.

### Background

The Bell UH-1H Iroquois, universally known as the "Huey" from its original HU-1 designation, is one of the most iconic military helicopters in history. The H-model entered U.S. Army service in 1967 as an improved variant with a more powerful Lycoming T53-L-13 turboshaft engine producing 1,400 shaft horsepower, increased transmission capacity, and modified rotor blades. Over 5,000 UH-1Hs were built, and the type became the defining image of American involvement in Vietnam.

During the Vietnam War, Hueys served in every conceivable role: troop transport ("slicks"), armed escort ("gunships" before dedicated Cobras arrived), medical evacuation (dustoff), command and control, and special operations insertion. The helicopter's distinctive "whop-whop" rotor sound became the auditory signature of the conflict. At the war's peak, over 2,500 UH-1s operated in-theater. The type suffered heavy losses—over 3,300 helicopters destroyed in Vietnam—but Huey crews earned legendary status for flying into hot landing zones under fire to extract wounded soldiers and deliver reinforcements. The call "Dustoff" for medevac helicopters became synonymous with the UH-1.

The UH-1H continued serving in U.S. forces through the 1990s before replacement by the UH-60 Black Hawk. The type remains in frontline service with numerous export operators worldwide and continues flying with law enforcement, firefighting, and utility operators. The distinctive sound of a Huey remains instantly recognizable to anyone who lived through the Vietnam era. In DCS, the UH-1H is a high-fidelity module offering authentic Huey flight dynamics, systems simulation, and the ability to experience this legendary aircraft.

## UH-60A

**Internal Name:** `UH-60A`

**Type ID:** `UH-60A`

**Playable:** No

**Usage Notes:** AI-only transport helicopter for U.S. Army missions from 1980s onward.

### Background

The Sikorsky UH-60A Black Hawk is the U.S. Army's primary utility tactical transport helicopter, entering service in 1979 as a replacement for the UH-1 Huey after winning the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition. The Black Hawk was designed to meet requirements that emerged from Vietnam War experience: improved survivability against ground fire, ability to carry a full infantry squad of 11 combat-equipped troops, enhanced all-weather and night capability, and improved reliability and maintainability. The helicopter features twin General Electric T700 turboshaft engines, crashworthy seats, self-sealing fuel tanks, and redundant flight control systems.

The Black Hawk first saw combat during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada (1983), where UH-60As inserted Rangers and special operations forces under fire. During Operation Just Cause in Panama (1989), Black Hawks again proved their value for air assault operations. The type's defining moment came during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, immortalized in the book and film "Black Hawk Down." Two UH-60s were shot down by RPG fire during a special operations mission, and the battle that followed resulted in 18 American deaths—but also demonstrated the extraordinary efforts crews would make to rescue downed aviators.

Black Hawks deployed extensively to Afghanistan and Iraq throughout the 2000s and 2010s, serving in combat assault, medical evacuation, VIP transport, and special operations roles. The modified MH-60 variants operated by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) conducted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. The UH-60 family has been exported to over 25 nations and remains in production as the UH-60M, ensuring the Black Hawk will serve for decades to come.
