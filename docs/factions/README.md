# Strangereal Factions

These faction files define unit lists for nations in the Strangereal setting from the Ace Combat series.

## Aircraft Origins

In the Ace Combat universe, nations commonly operate aircraft from diverse origins. Fans theorize that arms manufacturers—particularly Belkan and ex-Belkan weapons companies—sold aircraft widely across Strangereal, resulting in mixed inventories that don't strictly follow real-world bloc alignments.

## File Format

Each faction file includes:

- A brief description of the faction and its real-world inspiration
- Aircraft list using DCS internal names
- Helicopter list using DCS internal names
- Ground unit list using DCS internal names
